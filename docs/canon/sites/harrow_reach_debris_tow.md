# Harrow Reach Debris Tow

**Location:** Outer ring, Sector E-4 Transit Lagrange  
**Environment:** Microgravity debris field with intermittent EM noise, low light, drifting scrap.

## Hazards
- Kinetic impacts from slow-drifting mass
- Abrasive particulate in suit joints
- EM scatter causing sensor dropouts

## Mission Profiles
- Bulkhead patch and tow-line anchor under drift
- Container capture and safe spin-down
- Beacon placement for automated sweepers

## Logistics
- No resupply; work parties stage from tender once per six hours
- Tool loss likely; minimized by tether discipline

**Comms:** Short-burst, line-of-sight repeaters; fallback to coded lamp.  
**Extraction:** Grapple pick and tether reel; ten-second windows.

## Go / No-Go
- Go if EM < level 3 and drift speed < 0.8 m/s
- No-go on shard bloom or repeater blackout

---
**Use in story:** Establishes edge conditions for responder pilot. Good for practical wins, tool losses, and mesh rail checks.
