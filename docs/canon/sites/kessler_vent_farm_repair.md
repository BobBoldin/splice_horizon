# Kessler Vent Farm Repair

**Location:** Atmospheric processor array, Sector B-9 lower decks  
**Environment:** Hot, corrosive plumes; high humidity; poor visibility.

## Hazards
- Flash heat spikes
- Caustic condensate on exposed skin
- Ladder wells with low-oxygen pockets

## Mission Profiles
- Vent gate jam clearance in live conditions
- Fan-stack swap under partial shutdown
- Sensor mast recalibration

## Logistics
- Parts cache in sealed lockers; minimal lift access
- Cooling gel and rinse station every fifty meters

**Comms:** Wired talkback preferred; RF unreliable near stacks.  
**Extraction:** Vertical hoist in ladder well; stretcher compatible.

## Go / No-Go
- Go if plume temp < 430 K sustained and pH drift within 0.5
- No-go on tandem fan failure or gel cache below 50%
