# Style Guide

- Avoid numbers heavy or system like language. Keep progression symbolic with marks, scars, rituals, and bonds.  
- Favor emotional stakes and cliffhangers. Use strong points of view and clear consent language in medical scenes.  
- Do not use forge language. Use splice, couple, weave, and knit with lattice metaphors.  
- Medical ethics vocabulary appears naturally, never as an exposition dump.
