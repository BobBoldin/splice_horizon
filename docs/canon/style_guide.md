# Style Guide

This guide keeps narration and dialogue clear for performance.

## Core audio rules

- Action-first, dialogue-last is the default.  
  *Beat.* “Line.”

- If a tag is required, place it before the quote with a comma. Use plain verbs.  
  *Nyra said,* “First sip.”

- No em dashes. Use periods or colons.  
  “The talk turned easy: small pieces of the day.”

- No ellipses. Use a brief sentence or a beat for silence.

- Numbers are spelled where practical.  
  “Twenty five years.” “Two notes.”

- Scene transitions are spoken by the narrator. Characters do not announce them.

## Clarity over negation

Prefer direct description to negative framing.  
- Do: “The room was quiet.”  
- Do not: “The room was not loud.”

Avoid “not X, but Y” constructions. State what it is.

## Figurative language

Keep imagery light and concrete. One image per beat if it truly helps understanding.

## Dialogue tone

- Natural cadence. Avoid stacks of clipped four to six word sentences.  
- Characters do not speak in slogans or maxims.  
- Keep technical terms concrete and short.

## Radio and PA patterns

- Brevity with character cue.  
  - “Copy.” *Dax kept the cadence even.*  
  - “Copy.” *Hale read the mirror line true.*

- Put comms context in the beat, not the tag.  
  - *Elias came over comms.* “Now.”

## Quick self-check

- Can this line be written as: *Beat.* “Line.”  
- If a tag remains, is it before the quote with a comma.  
- Exactly one concrete beat.  
- No em dashes and no ellipses.  
- Numbers spelled.

## Dialogue Quotes

- Always use straight ASCII double quotes (") for dialogue.
- Do not use curly “smart quotes” or other Unicode quotation marks.

## Concrete rewrite sample

**Before:** “Public channel,” Nyra said softly. “This is a notice to habitat services. Short transport along the basin path. Dust control will be light. Thank you.”  
**After:** *Nyra opened the public channel,* “Notice to habitat services. Short transport along the basin path. Dust control will be light. Thank you.”
