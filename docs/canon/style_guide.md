# Style Guide (Updated)

This guide controls narration and dialogue so the audiobook remains clear and engaging.

## Core audio rules
- No contractions in narration or dialogue.
- Numbers and symbols are spelled (for example, “ten,” “percent”).
- No em dash characters.
- Dialogue is conversational. Narration carries senses and context.
- Scene transitions are spoken by the narrator. Characters do not label transitions.

## Clarity over negation
Prefer direct description to negative framing.

**Do**
- “The skiff found its line and held steady.”
- “The room was quiet.”

**Do not**
- “It was not a stumble; it was a glide.”
- “The room was not loud.”

### Avoid chained negation formulas
Avoid patterns like **“not a this, not a that, but a …”** or **“neither … nor … but ….”** Replace with a plain affirmative line.

**Before:** “Not a hoof. Not a paw. A body that drags a part of itself and then lifts it. Maybe a tail that acts like a third limb.”
**After:**  “It does not look like hoofprints or paw marks. Something drags part of itself, then lifts it — a tail, maybe, working like a third limb.”

**Before:** “It was not music; it was machinery.”
**After:**  “The machinery kept time.”

## Avoid rhetorical opposites
Do not hinge sentences on binary opposites such as **“not X, but Y.”** State what it is, not what it is not.

**Before:** “Not fear, not anger, but resolve.”
**After:**  “He was resolved.”

**Before:** “The dune did not threaten; it invited.”
**After:**  “The dune sloped gently and drew them forward.”

## Keep figurative language restrained
Use light, grounded imagery. Avoid poetic flourishes that personify terrain or turn into aphorisms.

**Before:** “Rocks want to tell a story.”
**After:**  “Fractures and bands showed age.”

**Before:** “If a thought helps, I will speak. If silence helps, I will keep it.”
**After:**  “I will speak when guidance is needed. Otherwise, collect samples.”

Limit figurative lines to one per scene, and only if it aids understanding.

## Dialogue tone
- Use natural cadence. Avoid clipped stacks of four to six word sentences.
- Characters do not speak in maxims or slogans.
- Keep technical terms concrete and short when possible.

## Worldbuilding and science
- Introduce terms with a plain anchor (“glassback grazer, a small plated herbivore”).
- Use function-first descriptions in the field (“plates bend glare and shed heat”).

## Transitions
- The narrator signals new scenes (“Morning on Procurement Deck Two…”).
- Characters do not say “spoken transition.”

## Quick self-check before commit
- Search for: `not`, `neither`, `nor`, `but` in the same sentence.
- Replace negative frames with direct statements.
- Remove aphoristic pairs (“If X, then Y. If Z, then W.”).
- Read dialogue aloud for natural flow.

## Concrete rewrite example (Chapter 09)
**Before:**  
Renn laid a flag at the start of the marks. “Heavy traveler,” he said. “Not a hoof. Not a paw. A body that drags a part of itself and then lifts it. Maybe a tail that acts like a third limb.”

**After (preferred):**  
Renn placed a marker at the start of the trail. “Whatever made this was heavy,” he said. “It does not look like hoofprints or paw marks. Something drags part of itself, then lifts it — a tail, maybe, working like a third limb.”
