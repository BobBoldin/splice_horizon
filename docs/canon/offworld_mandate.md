# Offworld Mandate — Why Research Leaves Earth

## 1) Terrestrial models failed to mirror Spiral breakdown
Extensive pre-mission work on rodents, canids, primates, and humanized porcine lines plateaued. Spiral lesions in humans involve **microvascular wall fatigue** with a **glycoform L-7** signature and **turbulent pulse sensitivity** at body warmth. Terrestrial tissues either **did not reproduce the fatigue pattern** or triggered **aggressive immune repair** that masked it. Chimeric grafts held at bench temperature, then **delaminated under warm pulse** and breath shear.

**Conclusion:** Human Spiral pathology requires materials and lattice behaviors that terrestrial lineages do not provide at thirty-seven degrees for sustained periods.

## 2) Biosafety and Charter containment
The Continuance Charter requires **hard containment** for cross-kingdom graft research. Offworld labs give:
- **Closed ecological loop** and quarantine that does not endanger Earth biomes.  
- Tribunal, Advocate, and Clerk oversight per session with complete audit trails.  
- Article Twelve guardrails: **therapeutic scope only**; no field weaponization.

## 3) Orthogonal biology increases the search space
Independent evolution on target worlds produces **polymer families and tissue lattices** without Earth’s shared ancestry. Some show **reversible micro-bridging** at warm pulse and **low tear at constant heat**, which are the precise properties Spiral care needs.

**Example findings so far**
- **Glassback under-plate tissue:** reversible bridges that hold in thin oxygen.  
- **Lichen boundary enzyme:** self-limits spread and keeps borders tidy.  
- **Sunfan ridge polymer:** warms to a soft **basal film** that grips without tearing and can act as a **delivery substrate** for future attributes.

## 4) Legal and ethical pathway
Following early terrestrial disasters, Earth regulators imposed a **moratorium** on in vivo cross-kingdom splices beyond narrow exceptions. The Continuance missions are the **only lawful route** to continue first-in-human work under **Consent Tribunal** and **Article Twelve** supervision, with the Advocate present and revocation rights preserved.

## 5) Practical readiness and patient access
The CSV Meridian carries:
- **Spin-gravity suites** to tune shear and pulse loads to human ranges.  
- On-board **Consent Tribunal** and **Advocate panel** for real-time ethics.  
- A monitored **patient cohort** that has already consented to staged Phase-Beta work with defined observation windows.

**Bottom line:** Offworld research is not a spectacle choice. It is the only path that combines safety, legality, and access to the **orthogonal materials** Spiral care requires.
