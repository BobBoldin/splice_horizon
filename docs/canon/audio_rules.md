# Audio Rules

- Identify the speaker with an action first, then end the sentence with the dialogue.  
  *Beat.* “Line.”  
  - *Halden smoothed her sleeve.* “Practice.”  
  - *Draeven checked the board and nodded once.* “Cleared. Escorts inbound.”

- If a dialogue tag is required, place it **before** the quote with a comma. Use plain verbs like *said* and *asked*.  
  - *Nyra said,* “Notice to habitat services.”  
  - *Halden asked,* “Do you train when you are off shift?”

- Do not use **Name: text** formatting. Use an action cue instead.  
  - *Elias came over comms.* “Now.”

- Minimize tags overall. Keep the speaker clear through beats, position, and context.

- Numbers are spelled in narration and dialogue where practical.  
  - “Two clean notes.”  
  - “Five heartbeats.”

- No em dashes. Use periods or a colon for expansions.  
  - “The talk turned easy: small pieces of the day.”

- No ellipses. Use a short sentence or a beat for pauses.

- Scene transitions are spoken by the narrator. Characters do not label transitions.

- Avoid aphoristic cadence. Prefer plain speech.

- Avoid rhetorical opposites and chained negations. State what it is.

- Radio and PA style stays brief with one concrete cue.  
  - “Copy.” *Dax kept the cadence even.*  
  - “Copy.” *Hale read the mirror line true.*

## Read-aloud checklist

- Action first, dialogue last when possible.  
- If a tag must remain, it is placed before the quote with a comma.  
- One beat per line and it is concrete.  
- No em dashes. No ellipses. Numbers spelled.
