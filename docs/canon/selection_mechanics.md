# Selection Mechanics

1. **Volunteers first.** Adults with Spiral in early to mid course, clear understanding, and no coercion signals. Advocate verifies comprehension and willingness.

2. **Family volunteer list second.** Filed at embarkation and re-verified by the Advocate before each intake window.

3. **Shortfall mechanism â€” Continuance Rotation (Section Fifteen).**  
   When volunteers remain short at the end of the quarter **after** outreach and screening, selection proceeds by **Continuance Rotation under Section Fifteen of the Venture Bond**. This is a rostered call, **not a chance game**.
   - **Scope.** Applies only to ship-wide, Tribunal-approved **therapeutic trials** that serve community value (for example, Phase-Beta steps limited to delivery and sensing). It does **not** apply to performance or field weaponization work (see **Article Twelve**).
   - **Eligibility.** Households with **open medical service obligations** are called **in roster order**.
   - **Exclusions.** Minors; individuals with critical medical exemptions; holders of essential duty posts under alert status.
   - **Substitution.** A called household may present a **substitute volunteer** of **equal or closer medical indication**, subject to full medical screening.
   - **Hardship relief.** The **Advocate panel** hears hardship requests and may grant relief or deferral; all rulings are recorded.
   - **Consent and oversight.** Each selection requires **Tribunal consent**, **Advocate presence**, clear-language packets, and full revocation rights.
   - **Cadence.** Intakes are scheduled at consistent intervals (for example, **every three days**) until the cohort is complete. No household may be called **more than once per year**.
   - **Transparency.** Notices list scope, dates, contact, substitution option, and hardship pathway in **plain speech**. The Clerk posts weekly anonymized metrics.
   - **Records.** The Clerk maintains the rotation roster, relief decisions, and appeal outcomes for Tribunal audit.

4. **Cooling period.** Twenty-four hours after counseling with a right to revoke until preparation begins.

5. **Monitoring.** Phase-Beta requires **forty-eight hours** of in-suite observation after application, then daily checks. Escalate on warmth above four of ten, radiating tingling, or trace drift beyond the set band.

> **Note:** Typical Phase-Beta cohorts run **five patients**, one at a time, unless the Council authorizes a different number under Tribunal oversight.
