**Series Title:** The Splice Horizon  
**Program:** The Splice Horizon Initiative  
**Ship:** CSV Meridian

## Mission and Charter
- **Goal:** Identify, harvest, and translate regenerative or anti degenerative traits from alien biota to treat **Spiral Atrophy (HDS nine)**.
- **Core Constraints:**
  - **Article seven — Human Integrity Clause:** No self or family trials. Clinical splices require explicit consent and multi signoff by Lead Integration Surgeon, Ethics Board, and Patient Advocate.
  - **Article twelve — Non Weaponization:** Grafts may not be fielded as weapons except under emergency override by the **Continuance Council**.
  - **Article three — Open Benefit:** Any successful therapy must be manufacturable at scale and equitably deployed across the colony.

## Why the Tharros and Veylin Family Joined
- **Selection Path:** Families with HDS nine markers prioritized for berths under Open Benefit.
- **Venture Bond:** Elias signed to contribute medical expertise toward the cure. Typical term twenty five to thirty years.
- **Catalyst:** A standard, pre launch surgical failure convinced Elias to seek alien lattice traits.
- **Boundary:** Under Article seven, **no experimental splices on Liora** until protocols reach **Clinical Phase Gamma**.

## The Illness: Spiral Atrophy (HDS nine)
- **Lay Term:** The Spiral.
- **Clinical:** Degenerative **micro lattice collapse** affecting connective and mitochondrial coupling. Current human meshes fail long term attachment.
- **Symptoms:** Progressive tremors, fatigue surges, tissue micro tears, loss of fine motor stability. Prevalent aboard CSV Meridian.
- **Current Care:** Triage, enzyme boosters, temporary scaffolds. Palliative only.

## Ship Organization
- **Xenobiology and Tissue Integration:** Elias Tharros and Mira Jeylan. **Lattice Suites**, **Splice Bays**, **Coupling Lab**.
- **Procurement Corps, Wardens:** Captain Rourke Draeven. Field hunts and specimen capture.
- **Consent Tribunal:** Ethics and patient advocacy. Oversight of trials and consent fidelity.
- **Continuance Council:** Commander Aric Veynar. Resource allocation and emergency overrides.
- **Courier Guild:** Joren Calrix. Logistics chain for specimens, reagents, and records.
- **Solwyn Circle:** Nyra Solwyn cohort. Living pattern mapping that parallels lattice modeling.

## Key Facilities
- **Vivarium Rings**. Quarantine habitats for alien lifeforms and controlled observations.  
- **Splice Bays**. Negative pressure operating theaters for integration procedures.  
- **Lattice Suites**. Modeling and pre op integration prep spaces.  
- **CryoArchive**. Long term biobank for tissues, lattices, and serum libraries.  
- **Coupling Lab**. Micro lattice attachment research with **micro couplers** and **graft matrices**.

## Devices and Lexicon
Preferred verbs: **splice, graft, couple, weave, knit**. Avoid any forge terms.

- **micro coupler**. Instrument to encourage lattice attachment at micro scale.  
- **lattice loom**. Modeling rig for patterning dynamic tissue lattices.  
- **graft matrix**. Adaptive scaffold that mediates host and alien coupling.  
- **integration lattice**. The resultant coupled network after a successful splice.

## Clinical Phases and Consent
- **Phase Alpha**. Pre clinical modeling. In vitro coupling only.  
- **Phase Beta**. First in human splices. Narrow indication. Intensive monitoring.  
- **Phase Gamma**. Durable outcomes across twenty or more patients. Scale up authorized.

**Consent Protocols:** Written consent with Patient Advocate present. Tribunal recording. Audit trail in medical ledger. Families and minors require guardian consent and Tribunal review.
