# Prose Patterns — Do and Do Not

## Negation chains
**Do not:** “Not wind, not song, but rhythm.”  
**Do:** “Wind moved in steady runs.”

## Rhetorical opposites
**Do not:** “It was not danger; it was welcome.”  
**Do:** “The approach felt safe.”

## Overly poetic personification
**Do not:** “Rocks told stories.”  
**Do:** “Fractures and bands showed age.”

## Maxim cadence
**Do not:** “If a thought helps, I will speak. If silence helps, I will keep it.”  
**Do:** “I will speak when needed.”

## Chapter 09 trail example
**Before:** “Not a hoof. Not a paw. A body that drags a part of itself and then lifts it.”  
**After:**  “It does not look like hoofprints or paw marks. Something drags part of itself, then lifts it — a tail, maybe, working like a third limb.”
