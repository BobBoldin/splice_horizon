# Prose Patterns — Do and Do Not

## Dialogue shape

**Do:** lead with a beat, end with the line.  
- *Dax lifted a hand to the server.* “Water is good.”

**Do if a tag is required:** put the tag before the quote with a comma.  
- *Nyra asked,* “Do you dance?”

**Do not:** use **Name: text** formatting.

**Do not:** stack body-part beats. Vary with instruments, room tone, smell, temperature, range, or readouts.  
- *Nyra checked the slate glow.* “Filter set.”

## Negation chains

**Do not:** “Not wind, not song, but rhythm.”  
**Do:** “Wind moved in steady runs.”

## Rhetorical opposites

**Do not:** “It was not danger; it was welcome.”  
**Do:** “The approach felt safe.”

## Overly poetic personification

**Do not:** “Rocks told stories.”  
**Do:** “Fractures and bands showed age.”

## Maxim cadence

**Do not:** “If a thought helps, I will speak. If silence helps, I will keep it.”  
**Do:** “I will speak when needed.”

## Punctuation and numerals

- No em dashes. Use a colon for lists or a period for a clean break.  
- No ellipses. Use a sentence or a beat for pauses.  
- Spell numbers in narration and dialogue where practical.

## Compact examples

**Before:** “Cleared,” Draeven said. “Escorts inbound.”  
**After:** *Draeven checked the board and nodded once.* “Cleared. Escorts inbound.”

**Before:** “Not a hoof. Not a paw. A body that drags a part of itself and then lifts it.”
