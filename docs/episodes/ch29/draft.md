Chapter 29 - Edge Doctrine

The door to Conference Six sealed and left them with the long table, the cold water, and the quiet that comes before a fight no one will call a fight. Veynar sat at the far end with a folder he had already read twice. He kept his hands flat on the table so he would not fidget. Colvern set a slim case down, unclipped it, and laid out a neat row of printouts like she was building a small bridge one plank at a time. Colonel Rane took a chair off to the side where she could see both faces without being a wall between them.

Colvern opened without warm-up. \"We are past the point where crates solve anything. The leading edge is running into hard places with thin lines. Resupply is a story people tell each other to feel better. Out there you do not pack enough rounds to matter. You bring people who do more with the bodies they already have.\"

Veynar watched the way she did not blink when she spoke. \"You want more of the ox type, but without the parts that break men in half.\"

\"I want frames that carry, strike, and recover,\" she answered. \"Not showpieces. No more chests like statues and arms that snap. Clean legs. Heat-managed cores. Hands that do not shake when the work stacks. We have the base mesh. We have field data. Take out what failed. Keep what worked. Scale it.\"

Rane looked at the printouts and back to her. She did not need Colvern to say living bullets. She could hear it anyway. She tried to cut it into something she could stand behind. \"You are asking for an expansion of stabilized traits into service roles. Disaster lines and hull breaches. Toxic bays work or pulls in vacuum when the safety tether jams.\"

Colvern nodded. \"Exactly. We have hulls being chewed and atmospheres that burn lungs. I do not want to send kids with tool belts to die where an adjusted frame can stand the heat for two minutes longer and make the difference. I want us to build crews that do not wait for a crate that is never coming.\"

Veynar let the words roll through and then back. He thought about Kaela's age and Joren's, and then he pushed those faces aside because personal pictures have a way of tilting policy. \"You want a program that pushes load out of logistics and into tissue. I hear the logic. I also hear the cost when it goes wrong. We just watched a man bounce himself to death in a mine because someone thought a reversed joint was clever.\"

Colvern's mouth tightened. \"That was undisciplined work in a basement. I am asking for leadership on our side. We cut out spectacle. We select for function. We start with compliant frames. We make small pushes: oxygen debt handling, micro-plate reinforcement without calcification, thermal buffering to ride a hot bay for a set count. No one is asking for monsters.\"

Rane shifted and chose her words. \"If we do this, we need clear lines. Volunteers only. Full language on risk. Medical oversight with teeth. Pulls at the first sign of drift. And we keep these people as people with names and pay, not hardware to be swapped out.\"

Colvern looked at her like a woman who had offered a workable cost. \"We can do that. Call them responders. Put them on the rosters where settlers see them fixing the things that scare them. Give the ships a face that is strong and human.\"

Veynar flipped the folder shut because he knew the pages by heart. He weighed the part of him that wanted the hard no against the part that lived in reality and bought better choices where bad ones were already on the table. He could feel the decision looking back at him. \"What do you need to start this without breaking the ship.\"

\"A pilot with fifteen,\" Colvern said. \"Five from stations that want the work. Ten from ships that already run at the edge. All volunteers. Informed, recorded, retrievable. Traits limited to mesh-based improvements we understand. No visible builds. No arms like clubs. No legs that skip a hinge. We test in real conditions. We let the results speak.\"

Rane nodded once. \"We can keep it quiet and clean for now. We can pick sites where a win is obvious and a failure is survivable.\"

Veynar felt the old weight settle across his shoulders, the kind that comes when there is no perfect answer and you have to choose anyway. He looked at Colvern and saw no cruelty there, only the focus of someone who hates losing to physics. He looked at Rane and saw the kind of officer who will stand in front of a bad call if it comes to that. He thought about the reports from the outer hulls where men had passed out in suits because the line ran hot and the scrubbers clogged and the repair took one minute longer than they had. He thought about the holdouts in the tunnels and the base mesh being twisted in back rooms by people who did not care who bled.

\"We do not put this in a pretty speech,\" Veynar said. \"We call it what it is: a responder pilot for hostile environments. We keep it small. We set standards higher than comfort. And we put a kill switch on the program if the first numbers come back wrong.\"

Colvern exhaled slow, not a victory lap, just a release of breath she had held since the door closed. \"I can live with that. You will, too, when the first breach team walks back in with two more people alive because someone could hold their breath ten seconds longer and lift twice their weight.\"

Rane let a corner of her mouth lift. She had watched the Anvil die and had not liked any part of it. She could imagine a world where the same strength pushed a bulkhead into place and then went home to eat with people who loved him. \"We will need medical leadership who will say no to us when we get excited, I have a name in mind.\"

Veynar knew the name. He pictured Elias standing over a ledger and a lock-box and choosing a line that hurt him to cross because his daughter needed a better tomorrow. He felt the ground give a little under his feet and forced himself to balance.

Colvern slid one last printout across the table. \"Here is what we start with, thermal buffering in short windows. Fascial reinforcement at the hips and shoulders to prevent tear under load. Lactate clearance tuned to keep hands steady. No cognitive pushes. We do not need faster minds on a breach line. We need steady bodies that do not quit.\"

Rane tapped the sheet. \"And a rule: no hero builds. We do not chase a legend. We build people who can work and then sleep.\"

\"Agreed,\" Colvern confirmed. \"The sponsor wants performance, not statues.\"

Veynar let himself feel the edge of irritation at the word sponsor and then let it pass. He did not get to choose the world. He only got to choose where to push it. \"We write the brief and tie it to outcomes that are boring to brag about and easy to measure. Days without injury. Minutes saved on a hot repair. Oxygen reserves at the end of a pull. If those numbers go up, we keep going. If they do not, we stop and say why.\"

Rane's eyes cut to Veynar. \"And we keep our people close. No hidden labs. No off-book couplers. Every part tagged and traceable. If a rumor says otherwise, we drag it into light.\"

Colvern let the room breathe. She could feel Veynar's reluctance and respected it, not because she wanted to be kind, but because that friction keeps leaders from doing the stupid version of the right thing. \"You will have my draft by nightfall. Pick your fifteen. I will bring three sites that meet mission criteria.\"

Veynar took the folder and stood. He felt older than when he walked in and also steadier, which is a strange trick a hard decision sometimes plays. \"You will get your pilot, but you will also get my hand on the brake.\"

\"I can work with that,\" Colvern answered. \"I prefer a brake I can see.\"

Rane pushed her chair back and looked toward the door. She had a team to check on and a young man who needed someone to tell him that being thrown into a wall is not a sign he failed, just a mark that he stood where he said he would. She also had an image in her head of a cargo deck filled with smoke and a responder walking through it with a bulkhead on his shoulder. She wanted that to be real and not a story.

They filed out with the decision sitting between them like a tool no one wanted to name out loud. Veynar carried the folder, Colvern the case, Rane the picture of what might be saved. None of them pretended this would be simple. All of them knew the edge was closer than last year and not moving back.
