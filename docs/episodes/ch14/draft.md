Chapter Fourteen: Cold Entry

The transfer station hung dark over a dim blue limb of cloud. No traffic lanes, no beacon chatter. The hull wore old paint that had baked to a flat gray and then scuffed down to raw metal where loaders once kissed the corners. Docking rings sat open like empty sockets. A few panels still held their warning stripes, sun-faded and flaking.

Inside the service collar, the air had a dry taste, the kind you get from rooms that have been sealed too long. Dust drifted in slow sheets whenever a lamp brushed across a bulkhead. Someone had stripped cables from along the spine months ago and left the clamp scars in neat rows. Floor paint listed bays and routes that no longer matched anything. The letters peeled at the edges and curled like paper left in an attic.

The maintenance spine ran the length of the station, narrow and cold. Under the metal, you could feel the bones of the place. Cross members thudded when a boot hit the wrong patch. A few corners held pockets of heat where an old conduit still bled from a stuck valve. Condensation dotted those runs and left a mineral line that looked like chalk. Beyond that, it was dead air and the quiet of a building that used to have a job.

Most of the cargo row had been emptied in a hurry. Fork marks gouged the deck. A pry bar lay where it fell. In the distance, something light knocked against something hollow and kept time with the small pressure changes that moved through the frame. The whole place had the feeling of work that stopped in the middle and never came back.

Rook waved the team forward and put his voice low in their ears. \"Helmets tight. Lamps low. We are in and out.\"

He passed a slim black case to Tamsin. \"Carry it. Do not open it unless you have to.\"

\"Copy,\" Tamsin said. She clipped the case to her harness and checked the seal.

Geir cracked a knuckle and rolled his shoulders. Lio took point with a pocket lamp held tight to her wrist so the light stayed close. She crouched at the first panel and worked the latch with a quiet twist. The plate popped, and a colder breath slid over their faces.

\"Left, then down,\" Lio said. \"The main feed is dead past the bend. Cargo row is two levels below. We cut through the service bay and come at the tag from behind.\"

They moved single file. The rungs in the first drop were greasy in the middle and bone dry at the edges. Gloves squeaked in a way that felt too loud in that space. At the bottom, a narrow walkway hugged a wall of lockers stamped with numbers that no longer meant anything. Rook held them a moment to listen. No voices. No hum from active lines. Just the click and settle of cool metal.

At the door to cargo, Geir pried the panel with a flat tool and found the manual release. The wheel gave after a shove. The door opened half wide and stuck.

\"Through,\" Rook said. \"Watch your pack.\"

They edged in sideways and let their eyes adjust. The crate they wanted stood three rows over on a low pallet, red latch bright in the lamp glow. Rook lifted two fingers and shaped a circle. Hold. Listen. A faint murmur carried from the far hatch, the kind you get from people trying to be quiet and failing.

\"Another crew,\" Geir whispered.

\"Keep it simple,\" Rook said. \"No talk. Lift and go.\"

Tamsin set her lamp down, knelt, and slid a cutter under the first seal. The strip popped clean. Lio drifted off the line and settled into the corner with the short barrel resting on her knee. Geir reached for the second seal.

\"Wire,\" Lio breathed. She did not raise her voice. \"Stop.\"

Geir froze. Rook leaned in and saw it then, a thin line that ran under the latch and into the shadow beneath the pallet.

\"Back out,\" Rook said. \"Nice and easy.\"

They took two steps. The wire sang as it tightened and snapped. Pressure slammed the room, a hard slap that punched air from their chests. The lights cut to black. The far hatch slammed to a narrow wedge and jammed. A wind tore toward a crack in the bulkhead, then eased. Somewhere in the dark, metal rang like a dropped wrench.

\"Count,\" Rook said.

\"Up,\" Lio answered.

\"Up,\" Tamsin said.

Geir groaned. \"Up,\" he managed, and then hissed a breath through his teeth.

Tamsin's lamp found him half curled against a rib, shirt torn, a dark line scoring his side with a slow shine. She pressed gloved fingers around the wound and felt the steady push of a deep bleed.

\"Pressure's dropping,\" she said. \"We do not have ten minutes.\"

Rook slid the black case to her hands and watched the far hatch. Shadows moved there in a lump. The rival crew had ridden out the blast.

Tamsin snapped the latches. Inside sat a compact ring, three coupling pads, and two ampoules of fine gray dust. She met Rook's eyes, then the wound.

\"It is not built for this,\" she said, already pulling saline and a link tube. \"But it might hold him.\"

\"Do it,\" Rook said. He stepped a half pace to give her room and brought his lamp up so she could see without flooding the space.

Tamsin set the ring over Geir's side. \"Pads here and here,\" she told Lio, tapping two points with a finger. Lio pressed them down flat. Geir clenched his jaw and bit off a groan before it could emerge.

Saline went in. One ampoule cracked under Tamsin's thumb. Dust turned the mix the color of weak tea. She fed it into the port and thumbed the trigger. The ring tightened and hummed. Geir's bleeding slowed. His eyes opened. He blinked into the dark.

\"Lights off,\" he snapped. \"Too bright.\"

\"Lamps down,\" Rook said. He could feel the rival crew drawing closer on the other side of the cargo row. Light would just draw their attention quicker.

Tamsin kept her hands on the ring and watched the wound blanch and hold. \"We bought time,\" she said. \"This isn\'t a fix though, not by a longshot.\"

Rook nodded once. \"Move. Hot corridor to the dock. Stay tight.\"

They lifted Geir. He took his own weight after two steps and leaned only when the floor pitched under a buckled panel. Lio led with her lamp low and close, head turned like she was listening for something only she could hear.

\"Left,\" she said at the fork. \"Heat ahead. Short run. We can make it.\"

They went. Heat climbed as the corridor narrowed. A panel flickered to life and threw a hard white glare across Geir's face. He flinched, swore, and tore his gaze away.

\"Keep those off,\" he snapped.

Tamsin met Rook's eyes. \"He is touchy.\"

\"Keep him moving,\" Rook said.

Behind them, a voice rose from the cargo row, edged and hungry. The rival crew had found their feet. Rook set his jaw and picked up speed. The station air turned thin and hot, and the dock indicator lay two corners ahead.

The corridor bent left. Heat pressed in and made the air taste like old pennies. Paint curled on the bulkhead where a conduit ran under the skin. A thin rattle moved through the frame, like something loose two rooms away.

Lio slowed at a cross. She crouched, palm a finger's width above the deck, feeling for the draft. \"Right fork breathes. Two turns. Dock sign is faint but there.\"

They shifted right. The floor pitched down a few degrees and grit rolled under their soles. Geir kept one hand on the wall and one at his side where the ring sat. His jaw worked when a status panel popped and died. He did not look at it.

\"Close,\" Tamsin said, checking the color at the edge of the pad. \"Hold steady.\"

\"Moving,\" Geir answered, voice flat.

They passed a run of lockers that smelled like stale coolant and old rubber. A door hung on one hinge and tapped the frame with a hollow knock every few seconds. The sound set Lio's teeth on edge. She nudged it closed with her boot and the noise stopped. Somewhere above, a relay clicked and failed to catch.

The dock corridor opened into a square antechamber with a cracked viewport. Frost limned the edges of the glass where vacuum had tugged and then let go. The dock control stood to the right, handle missing from the manual wheel. Three panel lights tried to wake and could not decide. One glowed the color of weak fruit. The air smelled like dust and old oil.

\"Geir, wall,\" Rook said. \"Tamsin, check him. Lio with me.\"

They crossed to the wheel. The stem had a bare square where a handle should sit.

\"Tool bag,\" Rook said.

Geir slid the bag over with his boot. Rook dug past cable ties and a pry to a short wrench that would bite the square. He fitted it to the stem and leaned. The wheel gave a quarter turn and a shudder ran through the door. He leaned again. Metal groaned in the frame. The first panel light brightened to a steadier glow.

Lio stood with her lamp tight to her wrist and watched both approaches. Her breathing stayed even. Sweat ran along her jaw and pooled at the collar, then dropped.

\"Footsteps left,\" she murmured. \"Light, then none. They are picking their way.\"

\"Two more turns,\" Rook said through his teeth.

The wrench slipped and barked his knuckles. He set it again, slower, and felt the stem catch. He moved the wheel a little at a time. On the third pull, the door seals let out a tired sigh. The second panel light crawled toward green and stopped short. The lock bar did not lift.

\"Of course,\" Rook said, quiet.

He dropped to one knee, pried a small cover, and found a manual release buried under grime. Lio flicked her lamp down for a second. He cleared the channel with the edge of the wrench and pushed. A spring bit his thumb and stayed.

\"Stuck,\" he said. \"Salt.\"

Tamsin slid in beside him, set a flat blade against the spring, and leaned her shoulder. The release gave half an inch and refused the rest.

\"Again,\" Rook told her. \"On three.\"

They pushed. The spring fought and then broke free with a sharp ping that echoed around the chamber. The third panel light woke to a steady color. The lock bar rose a hand width and paused.

\"Manual,\" Rook said. \"Help me.\"

They got fingers under cold steel and lifted. The bar scraped up through old dust, inch by inch, until it cleared and slid into its seat with a dull clunk. The dock hatch did not open.

Silence settled for a moment. Rook stared at the seam. \"You have to be kidding me.\"

Lio's head tilted. \"They are closer.\"

Rook thumbed the inside panel. Power stuttered and threw a string of dead icons. He tried the outer cycle. Nothing.

\"Bypass here,\" Tamsin said, already tracing a cable run with two fingers. She found a side panel with a thumb latch, snapped it, and exposed a small relay block. \"Jump two and four.\"

Rook stripped a short wire and bridged the posts. The relay clicked, hesitated, and then caught. The hatch motor thumped once and held. A low vibration moved through the metal under their hands.

The rival crew's light touched the far corner of the antechamber and disappeared when they flicked it off again. A shoe scuffed. Someone breathed through their mouth.

\"Door,\" Lio said, voice almost not there.

\"Working it,\" Rook answered.

The motor engaged just enough to pull the hatch a fraction. A strip of black opened at the seal. Cold air slid past their cheeks and curled along the floor. The gap stopped at a width that would not pass a person.

Rook looked at the relay and then at the motor housing. \"We need one more pull,\" he told Tamsin. \"Quick.\"

She bridged the posts again. The relay clicked. Sparks spit once, a weak shower. The motor whined and tried. The hatch moved the length of two fingers and froze. The relay smell turned sharp and a wisp of smoke lifted from the block.

\"Burned,\" Tamsin said, wiping her nose with the back of her wrist.

Rook shoved a pry into the gap and levered. Metal flexed and came back. He changed angle and pushed lower. The pry bent by a small and ugly amount.

Behind them, light swept the wall and slid away. A voice shaped a warning they did not plan to honor. Rook flexed his hands once and looked at the gap with a calm that did not feel like calm.

\"Geir,\" he said. \"How are you?\"

\"Here,\" Geir said. He kept his eyes down and away from the lid light. \"Ring holds. I can move.\"

\"Good,\" Rook said. He laid both palms flat to the edge of the hatch and felt the vibration still moving under the skin of the door, a tired machine trying to do a job it had forgotten.

\"On three,\" he told them. \"We make room or we make noise. Either way, we go.\"

He set his stance on the cold deck. Lio checked the corner. Tamsin braced the pry against the lower lip.

Rook drew a slow breath that tasted like dust and hot varnish. \"One. Two.\"

The rival crew's step scraped closer.

\"Three.\"
