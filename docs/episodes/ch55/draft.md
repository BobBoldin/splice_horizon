**Chapter 55: Closeout and Aftermath**

The third day opened clear and dry. The ring teams bled the manifolds, logged the final counts, and capped the header without trouble. Clinics took their noon barrels on time, with two extra for the north quarter after a mid-morning call. The local office kept distance and honored the ledger. No kites flew near the masts. No brine gum showed at the intake fence. The wardens packed methodically and moved the last pallets toward the shuttle road.

Hale checked each strap and marked every latch with chalk. Dax walked the bond stakes and pulled the ground lines in a steady coil. Joren wiped the hose cuffs, checked for grit, and stowed them in nested rows. Veynar's no-ordnance order stayed in the brief notes, then slid to the bottom of the stack. The team had what they came for: water moved, clinics covered, and a clean exit to the starport.

The dock incident landed the next day.

A lift at Bay Twelve skipped a tooth during a midafternoon hoist. A crate swung, a drum brake locked, and the floor boss shut the lane with a whistle and a clipboard. Shuttle crews lost their slot and began to stack schedules like cards with bent corners. Voices rose. A steward called for a full stop and a written inspection. By the time the message reached Meridian command, half the afternoon had drifted off plan, and three captains wanted someone to carry blame.

Captain Draeven took the call in the ready room. His jaw tightened for a beat, then eased. He asked for camera pulls, assignment charts, and the inspection sheet. Operations pushed a packet that displayed timestamps and route IDs. Nothing dramatic. Just delays that bred more delays.

He walked to the bay and found Hale, Dax, and Joren running a post-mission check on straps and stow. "Bay Twelve tripped a brake and shut down a lift," he briefed. "They want our crew on record because our crate ran that boom yesterday. We go in, we stay calm, we look at metal."

Hale pulled on a clean vest and clipped a chalk pouch to her belt. "Copy the calm," she returned, voice even. "Let us look at the gear."

They crossed the concourse and stepped into the heat of the docks. Engines thumped through concrete. A faint tang of grease mixed with old salt and hot dust. Bay Twelve wore yellow tape at the edge and a sign that displayed three boxes: stop, inspect, release. The floor boss stood with a steward and two shuttle pilots who looked eager to point fingers.

"You ran this boom yesterday," the steward opened. "We want your notes and we want your lockout procedure in writing."

Draeven met the eyes around the group and kept his tone steady. "We will provide both. First we examine the hoist and the chain, then we talk paper. If a link is shaved, you do not want my notes before we look."

The floor boss gestured toward the post. "Inspector is on the way," he returned. "You can look from here."

Hale stepped to the painted line and lifted a small mirror. The chain hung in a straight drop. Links were uniform until light struck one flat where finish turned dull. She eased the mirror closer. Two links showed file marks that interrupted the factory pattern. A tag string drooped from the guard with a paste-on sticker. The date matched the posted chart. The font looked wrong.

"Tag looks home-printed," Hale observed. "Finish is off on two links. That is not wear. That is a hand tool."

The floor boss stiffened. "We run checks," he offered. "We do not cut corners on chain."

"Nobody accused you," Dax returned, calm as a man reading a table of specs. He crouched at the foot switch housing, ran a finger along the screw heads, and held it up. "Fresh bite on these. Safety clip at the hinge is bent. There is a shard of old warning tab under the guard."

Joren pointed to the sheaves. "Third sheave shows a chip," he noted. "Not big. Enough to catch a plate under load. If the operator feathered it, the chain could hop."

The steward glanced at the floor boss. "We will need a change-out and a proof test," he ruled. "We will also need to log your notes, Captain. The shuttle crews are losing the day."

Draeven nodded once. "We will log," he agreed. "Before we do, I want the camera from the two hours before the incident. If someone shaved a link, they did it when the lane was quiet. If someone placed that tag, they did it with clean hands. I want both faces."

The floor boss hesitated, then waved a clerk toward the office. The clerk wore flat shoes and a wrist band that registered beacons as he moved. He kept his eyes down and his pace unhurried. He looked like every anonymous runner who ever moved paper across a hot floor.

"Who booked Bay Twelve yesterday," Draeven asked. "And who shifted crews this morning."

The steward checked a tablet. "Yesterday: manager Ortiz. Today: same. Crew rotation displayed at ten hundred. No flags."

Hale studied the post again. She did not use the word trap. She did not need to. Her hand traced the air where a steady chain should have run. "This was arranged," she offered. "Not to drop a crate. To stall a lane."

Dax scanned the faces around them. "A planned lane stall forces reassignments," he put in. "That pushes shuttle lifts late and gives someone time to move product or scrub records."

Draeven marked each step on a mental board. Locals had honored the water terms. The only pressure now ran through paperwork and routine. That was the Custodian's comfort zone. He could sand a day down to powder with forms and a file. He could pull attention away from an audit without lifting a hand in public.

The inspector arrived with a mirror and a stamp. He checked the links and the sheave, then wrote a pause order. He pressed a seal that displayed a relief image of the starport crest. "Chain out of tolerance," he announced. "Change-out required. Proof test before release. Bay Twelve is closed to lifts until I observe."

"Schedule the change-out now," the steward instructed the boss. "Pull a fresh set from stores. I want a rigger on that ladder in ten."

The boss worked the radio and turned grim. "Stores reports a paperwork hold," he replied. "The new chain pallet is in quarantine for a labeling mismatch."

Draeven almost smiled, then did not. Neat. Too neat. "Who flagged the mismatch," he asked.

"Manager Ortiz," the boss returned. "He logged a voucher discrepancy and blocked release."

"Get me the voucher," Draeven requested. "I want to see the string."

The clerk returned with a small drive and a paper sleeve. The drive registered to Bay Twelve on the band display. The paper carried a voucher copy and a receiving stamp. The font on the stamp did not match the others in the binder.

"Camera first," Draeven directed. "Play it."

The screen on the office wall displayed a narrow angle of Bay Twelve. Two hours before the incident, a man in a vest stepped into frame, checked the post, and walked out. Ten minutes later, a different man in a cap leaned into the guard and worked with small motions near the chain. He wore thin gloves. He used a short file and a cloth. Twelve minutes and he was gone. Five minutes after that, someone affixed a sticker. The camera caught only a sleeve and a hand.

The steward swore under his breath. "Pull him," he ordered the boss. "Find both. Now."

Draeven kept his voice even. "Do not spook the wrong one," he advised. "The file man might be a hired hand. That sleeve, since it knew to keep off the camera most likely belong to an insider."

The boss looked sick. "We keep records," he protested. "This shop runs clean."

"No one disputed your crews," Hale replied, steady. "This plays above your heads, and it uses your pride against you. Fix the gear. We will help you document the rest."

The inspector signed the change-out work order. A rigger rolled a ladder in, clipped on, and began to drop the chain by hand. The bad links displayed their file marks in the open light. The room grew quiet in that way a shop grows quiet when proof sits on the table. No one needed a speech.

The steward cleared his throat. "Captain, your crew's crate ran this boom yesterday. The manager will argue for a disruption fee and a re-rig."

"Re-rig is fine at base rate," Draeven returned. "Disruption lives with the person who shaved steel and pasted a fake sticker. Pull yesterday's camera too. If the same sleeve touched this post, I want that copy."

The boss nodded quickly and snapped at the clerk. The clerk jogged for once. Sweat darkened his collar as he disappeared into the office.

Dax crouched near the foot switch again and lifted the bent safety clip with two fingers. "This is not random," he stated. "Someone popped this to get a cover off fast. They put it back wrong to make noise when the brake hit."

Joren held up the fragment of warning tab between thumb and forefinger. "Old color," he noted. "Someone fished it out of scrap to match yesterday's camera angle. Sloppy."

Hale chalked a small X on the links that carried file marks and then chalked an arrow toward the post camera. "We take photos that display both," she told the inspector. "Chain and camera in the same frame. No one argues perspective later."

The inspector agreed and worked his lens with care. He did not posture. He documented. The steward's shoulders eased a fraction.

When the fresh chain arrived with a full tag set, the rigger installed it link by link, then ran a proof lift with a test block. The drum stopped when it should and held when asked. The inspector stamped release. The steward opened the lane. Shuttle pilots lined up again, faces tight, postures equal parts relief and resentment.

The floor boss turned to Draeven. "I want to thank you," he offered, voice rough. "You came in calm. You looked at metal. You did not call us crooked."

Draeven shook his hand. "You run a hard shop," he returned. "Someone leaned on you. That is not on your crew."

They stepped clear of Bay Twelve and moved into the shade near a stack of drums. The air felt cooler away from the engines. Distant clatter carried like a steady drumline. Hale leaned against the wall and rolled her shoulders. Dax checked the time. Joren drank half a bottle and tucked the rest into a pouch.

Draeven watched the walkway above. A runner with a red voucher paused at the rail. The same shoes from yesterday. The same band. The man looked down, then moved on. Too casual. Too timed.

"Ortiz," Draeven asked the steward, "is he in his office."

"Not now," the steward answered. "He left ten minutes before the jam. He returns when the mess is tidy."

Draeven nodded once. "That is his style," he observed. "He arranges strain and arrives after the apology. File your report. We will file ours. Colvern will push the camera to starport operations with copies for the union. If Ortiz argues fees, he can do it under that footage."

The steward exhaled. "Understood."

On the walk back, Hale spoke first. "This pulled us off the audit window," she remarked. "We should have run our checks an hour ago."

"That was the point," Dax replied. "He played the dock and our sense of duty at the same time."

Joren looked down at his hands, then up again. "We adjust," he offered. "We move the audit to tonight. Quiet, with our own eyes."

Draeven stepped onto the shuttle ramp and paused. The sequence resolved in his head: a lane stall, a chain shaved just enough to trigger a shutdown, a manager who preferred paper to presence, and a clerk who registered beacons at perfect moments. The Custodian did not need a fight to win a day. He needed time. He took it.

"Hydrate," Draeven told them. "File the notes. Meet at nineteen hundred in the map room. We look at vouchers, beacons, and faces. We write a list of questions with clean verbs and we follow them. No noise. No speeches. Just metal, paper, and people."

Hale nodded. "Neat," she returned. "We can run neat."

Dax half-smiled. "Neat is our flair."

Joren capped his bottle. "I will pull the camera angles and mark the timestamps," he offered. "I will also cross the voucher fonts. The wrong font keeps showing up."

"Good," Draeven concluded. "The locals kept their word and the mission closed clean. The rest is a shop problem with an owner. We find him in the gaps he likes. Then we close those too."
