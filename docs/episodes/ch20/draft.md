Chapter 20 - Lines on the Deck

**Years later** the ship runs on routines no one must explain. Maintenance days turn the atrium into an organized checkpoint, and the program names are now plain on every board. The base-mesh cohort is introduced ship wide as **Embers**, a practical label that matches what they do: keep warmth steady, steady people too. Interval care for enhanced stacks is posted as **Splicer Maintenance**, a calendar more than a judgment. Some roles are flagged for extra attention because of what they can safely lift, cross, or cut; their shorthand is simple and used like job titles: **Grips**, **Struts**, **Blades**.

Wardens drill the hand signals the same way deck chiefs teach ladder safety. Pairing sheets post beside the air-scrubber checklists, and security stations are set to recognize common tells so the lines move without drama. None of this is about status. It is traffic control for a busy ship. Teams form with these names in mind and then get on with the work.

The atrium serves as the ship's public square. Two open levels with railings, benches bolted to the deck, and a long desk that becomes intake on maintenance days. The lights are bright and even. Air moves cool from the ceiling to the floor. A wide tape stripe splits the room under a sign that leaves no room for argument:

**Embers: Left.**\
**Splicer Maintenance: Right.**\
**High-Risk Classes (Grips • Struts • Blades): Check in with Warden.**

Mira runs the desk. Slate on a stand, two clipboards, a box of clean pens lined up like tools. Hair up. Sleeves rolled. Voice clear without shouting. "Embers to the left for checks. Splicer maintenance to the right. Keep your bands visible. No crossing the stripe."

Elias stands two steps behind her with Kaela and a small team. He watches gait and posture and the way hands settle when a person waits. Colonel Rane standing at the top rail with two supervisors, eyes on the whole floor. She rarely speaks from there. If the mood in the atrium shifts, she will see it first.

The Ember line moves quickly. Twice-a-year checks. A yearly reset. Their patch is a small hex with a thin red line through the center, worn high on the sleeve or low on a vest. Bodies look ordinary until a task needs warmth. Palms lift to seized fittings and frost softens in a minute. Parents talk about babies who run cool and the tricks that keep sleep from breaking. A technician with the patch taps her wrist and says to Mira, "Set me to simmer, not boil," and earns a brief smile because an Ember joke feels safe in this room.

The Splicer side is slower. People stand with a little space around them. Orange bands mark maintenance appointments. Some changes are plain. A man with eyes that catch light at odd angles rests under a pillar and blinks against the brightness. A woman with faint leafing under the skin at her wrists keeps her hands folded and steady. A deck lead in a gray jacket shifts from foot to foot, comfortable in cold bays and less so here. People once dyed their hair blue. Now some people are blue. Pigment runs in bands along necks and jawlines. Shoulders show clean glints in the dark. You do not need a story to see what the years have made.

Specialist Hale stands at the foot of the stairs in a Warden vest with a small triangle on the back. Her work is flow and perimeter. She is not a Splicer. She reads crowds the way engineers read boards. Palms up if space needs holding. Two fingers if a lane needs clearing. People know her signals and respond without turning order into a scene.

A Grip moves through security on the right. His wrist looks like a coupler, the thick web at the thumb obvious even at a distance. The hand scanner chirps when his palm comes down and the guard tells him to ease it. He lifts his hand and smiles once like a man who has learned to keep his grip for real work. A Strut stands farther back, nothing flashy until the alarm panel on the second level hiccups. Without a run-up he springs to the next deck, one clean rise, and palms the reset. The crowd does not cheer. They look up, see a problem handled, and go back to their place in line.

Mira keeps the rhythm. "Rivas: Ember check. Station three." Then, "Dami: Splicer maintenance. Station two." Consent is read aloud in plain words. No one treats the forms like a ritual. They are how the day runs without misunderstanding.

Three places deep on the Splicer side, a rigger named Voss shifts and then goes still. His jaw tightens. Eyes fix at chest height, not on faces and not on the clock. The orange band on his arm sits above a strip of blue that was not a dye job and never will be. His left hand curls on the strap of his tool bag. His right hand comes up to the level of his ribs.

Mira registers the change. She sets her pen down. "Voss," she says, level and clear. "Eyes up."

He does not answer. The strap lifts another two fingers.

Hale steps into the gap between Voss and the stripe and raises both palms, shoulder width. "Hold there." Years of Warden drills live in her stance: hips square, elbows soft, weight set to turn a person with leverage instead of force. People on this deck learned the hard way that ignoring that voice ends in a clean, efficient meeting with the floor.

Her reputation travels faster than the alarms. Once a crane hand tried to brush past her and woke up on a mat staring at ceiling rivets while Hale quoted the safety code by section and line. Another time she redirected a charging loader with two fingers and a step that looked like nothing until the loader's feet were somewhere else. The joke in the bays is simple and true: Hale does not have powers; she has physics and she studied.

Elias moves from behind the desk to three steps out. "Kaela: coil and bands."

Kaela brings the coupler kit to the desk edge, flips the latches, and sets the housing on the metal lip. The desk can carry the field if they need it. She holds one band ready, the other for Elias.

Mira's assistant slides into the chair and keeps the Ember line moving. The room quiets the way it does when people decide not to add their voices.

Elias speaks to what is in front of him, not to the room. "Voss, you are at your interval. Do not reach into the bag. We will handle it here."

Voss's mouth opens and shuts. Sweat beads at his temple in a cool room. The strap lifts again.

Hale adjusts her stance by an inch and fills the line of travel without contact. It is a Warden move: make the safe choice the easy one.

Kaela clips the band to Elias's forearm and lifts the second. He nods. She snaps it around Voss's arm fast and clean. The coupler meets the desk lip with a click. The small indicator goes from red to amber. The metronome ticks at a slow, even count.

Elias lifts his forearm so the band sits in Voss's view and nods to the wall slate. The screen shifts to open water, gulls riding slow currents, sunlight on swells. "Pick one bird and stay with it," he says. "Let the glide set your pace."

Voss's fingers hook at empty air, then settle on the strap. The indicator steadies and flashes green. Hale holds position, palms up, giving him room. The line behind him eases back a half step and stays quiet.

"Good," Elias says. "Hold that glide."

Green lasts longer. The strap sags. Voss blinks three quick times, then tracks to Elias's hand. He sees an open palm and a steady stance, not a threat

Hale lowers her hands a fraction. "Good," she says. "Stay with them."

Another breath. The indicator stays green. Voss's jaw loosens. The strap drops to his side.

"What did I do?" he asks. The words come dry.

"You hit your maintenance interval," Elias says. "You did the right thing by being here. We will finish in a room with a door."

Rane does not raise her voice from the rail. "Clear a lane. Station two is priority. No commentary from the line."

The path opens on both sides of the stripe. Mira walks with Voss, hand near his elbow without touching, the band still live. Kaela keeps the coupler pressed to the desk until the door closes behind them. The intake room breathes again. The left queue advances. An Ember at the front meets Hale's eyes and gives a short nod that is returned in kind.

Security checks continue. A Blade steps through the arch. The forearm ridge is permanent, wrist to elbow, hard as stone and honed to a line. When he turns his arm, the ridge catches light like a razor. The guard asks him to keep his sleeves down in the atrium. He smiles and rolls the fabric once. Everyone has heard the story by now. A Blade freed a pinned suit by sliding that ridge under the cuff and drawing once, clean through composite and frozen webbing, no heat and no sparks. No one asks for a demonstration. The ridge is proof enough.

Mira returns to the desk. Elias signs three forms so her assistant can keep pace. Hale resumes her post and scans for new problems. The Strut on the upper deck gives a small salute toward the desk and disappears into a side corridor. The Grip from earlier stands in the right line again with both hands open and still.

Rane comes down the stairs and stops beside Elias. "Third interval event in two weeks," she says. "Different decks. Same calendar."

"We will stagger new starts from today forward," he answers. "Pair an Ember near the stripe on maintenance days. Keep the room warm and folks hold their tempers along with their place."

"Put that to paper," came the order.

He nods and looks at the sign again. **Embers: Left. Splicer Maintenance: Right.** The stripe does its job. It keeps people from mixing without thinking on a day when thinking is the difference between a quiet shift and a report with red type.

Mira opens the station door and gives a small signal that does not interrupt the room. Voss is seated. The board is green. The metronome is off. The worst of it is over.

A kid on the upper rail whispers to another and points at the man with the shining eyes under the pillar. Adults pretend not to hear. The years have made a new shape out of the crew. It used to be that people feared what alien life might do to us out there. By any measure, we are becoming the thing we were warned about. We found alien life in the mirror. The line moves. The sign holds. The ship gets through another watch with order intact.
