Chapter 35 --- Quiet Math

Elias read the Wardens' report at his bench with the room set for work: steady light, clean glassware, and a slate that held only the words he needed. The summary kept to facts and left names out on purpose, which matched the request at the end: consider the medical implications if a senior handler carried sensory gains without visible cost. He let the words sit for a count, then pulled a pad and drew a narrow column for what could make that real.

He wrote the first line as a question because questions keep thinking honest. Could a splice ride clean when other bodies pay in tremor and judgment loss. The known pathways did not favor that outcome, yet rare pathways exist when timing, chemistry, and load land in a narrow band, so he marked three possibilities and gave each a short trunk.

The first trunk read as chemistry. A rare cofactor might steady Sunfan's base mesh during early uptake and keep the vine from choking the ladder, especially at rungs that try to split. He listed candidates that live inside the body at low levels and rise during short windows: copper proteins that touch oxygen handling, chaperone proteins that steer folding under heat, and a class of amines that settle synapses after a surge. A synthetic version could travel with a dose and then fall away on schedule. If someone pulled that off, the third strand would fail to take root, and the splice would land with fewer scars.

The second trunk read as timing. A dose might walk through a narrow timing boundary that keeps the mesh helpful and the splice disciplined, with a taper built into the coupler head rather than pushed from the outside. He sketched a dosing curve that started soft, rose through a shallow slope, and quit before the body guessed it could braid a third line. That curve required a scanner that reads triplex markers in real time and a controller that respects the abort threshold without ego. A disciplined technician could achieve that in a clinic. A ruthless handler could enforce it in a back room by locking the device to a single profile and punishing departures.

The third trunk read as burden we cannot see. The body pays in private more often than in public. A man could stand clear-eyed in a room while his heart works in short runs, his vessels stiffen ahead of schedule, his hearing stays sharp at the price of sleep, and his sense of smell grows at the price of headaches he blames on light. He listed quiet costs: microvascular scarring in the inner ear, a small shift in sinus rhythm under load, endocrine strain that eats patience over months, and a hippocampal stress pattern that turns memory into a strict accountant. None of that shows on a badge. All of it shows on a scan if you know where to point the lens.

He lifted his eyes to the model of the ladder on the back shelf and pictured the amber strand that tried to form when mesh and splice overlapped. The detainee tissues had taught him how quickly a third line wants to grow when windows collide, and how quickly it fades when timing holds. Breath steadied. The math favored caution. The rumors asked him to explore what lives past caution.

He wrote a small note: senses sharpen through structure or chemistry. Structure meant cochlear hair cells tuned back toward youth, olfactory receptors kicked back into growth, and cortical maps widened by practice or force. Chemistry meant a baseline raised for transmitter cycling and modulated just enough to keep perception fast without throwing judgment forward into danger. He had seen the first path in children who trained early. He had seen the second in adults who paid later.

He set another column for tools. The Wardens had sent tissue from The Anvil and from detainees with curated seams, and those samples carried an enzyme trace that matched the gravemite husk reaction he had sketched during his surge. If that enzyme kept base mesh from overbinding at specific rungs, a handler with access to clean stocks could pair it with narrow windows and produce sharper senses for a time. He circled the enzyme and wrote: test interaction with base mesh under short cycles; monitor for triplex signal; watch for rebound after taper.

A soft tap at the frame drew his attention without breaking thought. Liora leaned in, held his eyes for a second, and placed a fresh cup on the bench, then left him to the work because the report had asked for a mind left alone with its tools. He wrapped both hands around the porcelain and let the heat anchor him while he read the last paragraph again. The Wardens did not ask for a witch hunt. They asked for guardrails strong enough to hold if the rumor proved true.

He listed what the ship needed before it needed names. First: a pre-fire scan that flags any attempt to stack windows, already built into the new couplers and set to enforce a hard usage limit. Second: a lab panel that reads for the quiet costs, because a body that carries a gift often carries a bill. That panel would track inner ear strain, small cardiac drift, endocrine load, and sleep fragmentation, and it would flag patterns that match long-term harm. Third: a reagent test keyed to the gravemite trace, because that enzyme could be the seam that keeps the vine polite, and the lab could learn to smell it on a slide and on a tool.

He wrote another trunk for ethics because plans collapse without it. If someone exists who walks through rooms with sharpened senses and a calm face, the ship needs to choose how to see that person: asset, patient, or threat. Asset drives secrecy and leverage. Patient drives care and timing. Threat drives force and short thinking. The Wardens wanted options that keep people alive and the ship steady, which placed his work at the center of a decision he did not control. He felt the familiar pull to hurry and let it pass, then returned to pace.

He mapped a test series that used no human risk. Cell lines first, then tissue models. Short base mesh windows with the enzyme in measured traces, offset splice pushes under tight timing boundaries, and real-time monitors that flushed the window when the amber signal tried to rise. He wrote the cutoff times in large numbers that any technician could follow without guessing. He kept the plan plain: help what needs help, cut off what tries to overreach, and log every step where a person might be tempted to nudge a timer.

He thought about Linda's line on senses: a heartbeat called from across a room, sweat caught at the first break, a gaze that forces the mouth to catch up. Structure alone rarely buys that spread. Chemistry alone often frays the edges. A third factor might sit behind the curtain: a rare amino acid imported in small vials, a heat-stable protein that rides the bloodstream for an hour, or a micro-dosed binder that keeps the mesh from gripping too hard while the splice lands. Supply would leave a paper trail somewhere: vendor names that repeat when part counts do not, small coolers that move through rooms that never need them, and a clerk who initials margins with care.

He wrote a short note for Rane to carry back to the team: if the rumor proves real, bring me air filters from rooms where the handler works, glove liners from carts touched during the hour you marked, and drain swabs from sinks near those paths. He could read traces on those without asking a body to sit under a scope.

The pad filled with tidy lines, and the bench stayed quiet. He felt heat collect behind his eyes from long focus, then ease as he blinked and found his place. Fear had a place in the room, but it did not drive. The work would carry more weight than rumor if he kept it simple and verifiable.

He wrote the last card for himself, because the surge had tempted him once and could offer shortcuts again. House rules, not heroics. Safety boundaries visible on the wall. Timing boundaries built into the device. Abort thresholds that trigger without waiting for permission. A cooldown kit within reach when people push beyond design, and a culture that believes in stopping before a gift turns into a debt.

He set the pen down and pulled a fresh page. At the top he printed three lines for the briefing Liora would want on one sheet: If a clean splice exists, chemistry, timing, or hidden cost makes it possible. We can detect each path with panels and scans we already own or can build within a week. If we confirm a case, we treat the person as a patient under guard and the network as a supply chain under pressure.

He read it once for tone and once for leaks, then slipped the page under a clip and reached for the console. The message to the Wardens used plain language and left space for them to work: send the samples and the locations; hold off on names until the lab can give shape to the rumor; expect a method that protects lives while it narrows the field.

He sat back and let his shoulders rest. The room sounded like a lab again: vents steady, glass quiet on steel, and a chair that rolled true when he shifted. He felt the clean pull of purpose in his chest and the steady count that comes when a plan fits inside a day. The ship would need more than answers; it would need a way to hold a truth that people fear and still keep its hands clean. He could give them that way if he stayed within the boundaries he drew on the wall and kept every step plain enough for a tired technician to follow at four in the morning.
