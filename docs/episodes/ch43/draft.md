Chapter 43 --- Terms of Strength

The room kept a steady light and a square table. Commander Colvern placed three folders in the center and aligned them with a thumb. Rane took the seat nearest the door with both hands flat and a calm breath that set the tone. Hale slid in beside her, helmet clipped to the chair back and eyes steady. Dax leaned his Longcoil case against the wall and sat upright with the posture of a man who counts weight like a second language. A chair waited for Joren with its back to the wall and a clear path to the hall. He would need that after this meeting, one way or the other.

Colvern opened the first folder. "This is a volunteer offer," she began, voice even. "Three permanent suites built for capture-first work. Medical stands next door and holds the keys. Logs will read clean and complete. Command will hold the line on usage limits. We bring speed and strength to your bodies, and we keep judgment in your heads."

Rane kept her eyes on the folders. "This unit answers to duty," she added. "No one takes this for trophies or stories. We carry it for the room that needs it."

Colvern slid one page to Hale. "Reflex and sight, tuned for short rooms," she outlined. "You gain faster posture corrections, quicker hands, and a steadier visual read under strobe and smoke. Your window becomes a baseline. The panel will track quiet wear at the inner ear and along the small tendons of the wrist and ankle. Rest days live on the schedule, not on feelings."

Hale read the single page, traced one finger along the line that described taper days, and set her palm over her sternum for a breath. "I take it," she voiced, warm and simple. "This keeps civilians standing and puts heads on the floor without broken ribs. That is my work."

Colvern slid the second page to Dax. "Load and frame," she set. "Shoulder chain, hips, and spine. You keep control at the end of long counts. Your hands stay steady on the heavy gear after four hours of push and pull. The panel will show joint heat and small fiber fatigue. Rest days land with math, not with stories."

Dax scanned the lines, glanced at Rane, and gave a short nod. "I accept it," he answered. "A scene stays honest when the backbone holds. I prefer math to fables."

Colvern rested her hand on the third folder and looked toward the door. The hall unit gave a soft tone, and a medical transport rolled through with Joren upright and braced, Kaela at his elbow, and Elias half a step behind with a folder against his chest. Joren moved with care. The brace met each step like a tool and not a cage. Kaela walked close enough to steady him if he asked. He held the rail and kept his mouth closed until he reached the chair and stood behind it.

"Permission to remain on my feet," he requested, breath even, eyes level.

"Granted," Colvern returned. "You may sit if you choose."

He kept his hands on the chair back and stayed upright. Elias took the wall where he could read faces and leave if any look asked him to. Kaela stood between Joren and the table and rested her hand where his rested, not to hold him down, but to let him feel that she saw him.

Colvern slid the third page toward the near edge of the table and turned it so Joren could read it without moving. "Bone and tendon reinforcement," she briefed. "Permanent, not a window. You walk free of braces and bars. You return to full duty if the panel says your frame carries the work. Taper days sit on the calendar. Rest weeks land every quarter. Medical checks hold after every shift for the first month, then shift to a sane pace."

Rane lifted her eyes to Joren. "I brought this to you because you earned the right to choose your next hour," she told him. "Your team holds your place for as long as that choice requires. We stand with you either way."

Joren looked once at Kaela. Her face carried calm on purpose and worry under that calm. He read both and kept them where they belonged. He turned to the page and moved one hand to the paper. His thumb tracked the line that listed risks: inner-ear drift over years if rest goes poorly, tendon micro-tears under stubborn load, bone bruise if pride overrules taper. He did not blink away from the words.

Elias watched the eyes and the hands and let his mind work where only he could hear it. The bone suite held a clear promise if they kept the counts and the rest honest. The outcome for Joren read strong: unaided steps, clean balance, full duty within weeks rather than months. The map for Kaela lived behind that. A permanent architecture that carries load without snarling chemistry. A way to lift scaffolds off the base mesh so the vine climbs and does not choke. He kept that hope sealed behind his teeth. He would not turn a man's choice into a lab bet, and he would not sell a daughter a dawn until he held it in his hands.

Kaela reached with her free hand and laid two fingertips on the margin where the consent line waited. "We do questions before ink," she offered, voice warm. "We keep plain words. We draw the counts on the board if we must."

Colvern accepted that with a simple nod. "Ask," she invited.

Joren cleared his throat once. "How long until I walk this corridor without help," he pressed. "I want a number I can carry."

Elias stepped forward one pace, measured his tone, and kept it clean. "Three days until the anchors set," he answered. "Seven days until your stride reads strong inside the room. Two weeks until your balance carries on turns with a full kit. That model comes from people who respect rest and allow taper days to land when the panel calls them."

Joren held the numbers in a quiet count. He looked at Hale, then Dax, then Rane. Hale's face carried joy held in check because she honored the weight of the room. Dax's jaw eased by a small fraction, the way it does when math aligns. Rane's eyes warmed and stayed steady. He turned back to the table.

"What parts change in my head," he asked. "I want the flavor of it."

Elias kept his answer steady. "Your head keeps its original flavor," he assured. "This package lives in bone and tendon and proprioception. Reflex lands in the joints, not in impulse. Your judgment stays your own. The panel watches the small balance muscles along the spine. We hold rest days where the numbers place them."

Kaela's shoulders eased a hair. She kept her hand on his and looked at the page rather than at his face. "What limits protect him during the first month," she followed. "We make them clear now."

Colvern printed them on a small card so no one needed to remember from air. "No long sprints in armor before week four," she listed. "No carries over one hundred pounds without a second set of hands for the first two weeks. No solo rooms until medical clears the first panel. A taper day gets pulled forward when the meter runs amber. Your captain and your medic place those days. The conversation happens after the rest, not before."

Rane looked to Joren and kept her voice quiet enough to fit between them. "Your team will carry the load while you build the new body," she promised. "We chose this path because we trust discipline more than luck."

He kept his thumb on the consent line and breathed through a long count. He had pictured this corridor with Kaela at his side and wanted steps that felt like his steps. He had promised himself that he would carry whatever came next on legs that carried their share. The brace helped today. The brace would leave soon. He held the page steady with one hand and closed his eyes for the space of one slow inhale.

Elias watched the muscles at the jaw and the neck. He could measure the minute shifts now with a mind that ran brighter than it once had, but he did not trust that brightness as a master. He trusted plain work and the patient discipline that makes labs honest. He saw three paths in front of Joren. Long rehabilitation with a brace and stubborn hours. Permanent reinforcement with a panel and a calendar that never apologizes. Fear dressed up as wisdom that keeps a young man standing beside a wall for a year and leaves him hungry.

He thought of Kaela's counts, the base mesh that wore on her when the day ran long, the taper tweaks he had written into a private file in a hand that stayed clear even when the heart ran hot. He wanted to hand her a world that did not force choices between steady life and steady hands. He looked at his daughter and met the part of himself that wanted to push. He set that part down and kept his mouth closed. A person earns trust by choosing silence exactly here.

Joren opened his eyes and found Kaela's gaze already on him. She did not move closer or farther. She let him meet her where he needed. He touched the consent line with the tip of the pen and did not press down yet.

"I want the team at my back before the next sweep," he voiced, breath level. "I want to stand in a room with Hale and Dax and make choices without checking whether my body keeps up. I respect the year that rehab asks for, and I understand that the end of that road still might not bring me home. I choose the body that brings me home now with work I can measure."

He pressed the pen and signed with a hand that stayed steady. Kaela closed her eyes for a count and opened them with a smile that lived in the eyes more than on the mouth. Rane set her palm on the table once, then lifted it because she preferred touch to mean something.

Colvern stood and reached across to turn the page around for the file. "We honor your choice," she affirmed. "Medical will begin the anchor set within the hour. Your team will rotate through training while you build stride. We keep rest honest, and we do not leave each other behind."

Hale rose and crossed the small space. She met his eyes and gave him a nod that carried ten years of rooms in a single motion. "We walk you down that corridor when the panel says go," she promised. "I will count the marks. You will keep the pace."

Dax leaned forward with forearms on the table. "I bring a light pack on your first lap," he offered. "We add weight when your balance laughs at me."

The corner of Joren's mouth moved for the first time since the door opened. "Bring the heavy pack on the third lap," he returned. "I plan to enjoy the first two."

Kaela kept her hand on his. "I sit in the room while the anchors set," she told Elias, voice steady. "I read the monitors and I breathe where he can hear me."

"You will sit at his left," Elias replied. "The panel lives at his right. The count will sound calm."

Colvern closed the folder and gave it to Rane. "Carry this to medical and log the time," she instructed. "I will brief the captain and inform him of the formal authorization for the splice work."

Rane took the folder and rose. "We will carry this right," she answered. "We carry everything right."

They moved as a group to the medical bay. The corridor kept its regular light and the familiar rhythm of boots and soft wheels. Joren walked without hurry and let the brace work with him. Kaela matched his pace with small corrections at the elbow only when his foot found a seam. Elias walked a half step behind and tested every word he planned to say inside his skull before he allowed any of them to leave his mouth.

In the bay, the anchors waited on a clean tray. Bone contact arrays, tendon reinforcers, and a proprioception line coiled like a tool that respects work. The room smelled like cold metal, clean cloth, and a hint of citrus from the last wipe-down. Monitors sat square. The bed looked like a bench with straps that never lied. A technician checked cuffs and lines. Two nurses reviewed the checklist. The slate by the door carried the three key lines in block letters: consent logged, rest days scheduled, panel at hand.

Elias walked Joren through each step without theater. "Anchor points at the shins and forearms first," he briefed. "Tendon contact along the knees and hips. We pulse in small cycles for two hours with quiet counts. The panel will watch your balance while you lie still. You will feel pressure, warmth, and a sense that your joints think ahead of you by a step. That feeling turns into fluency across the next week. You keep a simple journal. You eat salt and protein. You drink water like it pays rent."

Joren nodded, lay back, and placed his hands along his ribs. Kaela took the chair on his left and set a hand on his forearm. She leaned closer without leaning on him and kept her breath at his pace. Rane stood at the foot of the bed with her hands at the rail, not to hold him down or to hold herself up, but to stay connected to the work. Dax stood at the head, eyes on the display, taking in numbers like a man measuring wind before a lift. Hale took the wall that let her see faces and hands without crowding any person with her presence.

Elias checked the consent screen one last time, then looked at Joren and used the one word that turns a room honest. "Ready," he asked, tone even.

"Ready," Joren returned, with a steadiness that made the room breathe a little easier.

Elias nodded to the nurse on controls. "Begin anchor set," he directed. "Cycle one at low tone. Mark the count."

The first pulse traveled through the anchors as a pressure that felt like a firm hand at the bone. Joren's breath caught, then found its meter again. Kaela matched the meter and kept her hand warm. Numbers scrolled. The panel drew a line that rose a little and then leveled into a tight band. The machine did its work with the indifference of a tool. The people did their part with attention that made indifference meaningful.

Elias watched the subtleties. The small muscles at the ankle relaxed and then tightened in a smarter pattern. The knee found a home position and returned to it without complaint. The hips accepted the idea of balance as a shared job rather than a fight. The proprioception line sent a gentle signal down the spine that told posture to stand ready. He kept his face neutral and let the satisfaction live in his chest.

Kaela kept her eyes on the monitor that showed balance. A small ball rode in a short corridor between two lines. It drifted and then settled. She kept her face calm. Her heart beat hard enough for her to feel it in her throat. She did not look at Elias because she did not want anything from him except the work he was doing.

Joren focused on the ceiling tile with the tiny scratch near the frame. He used that as a beacon to hold his mind steady. He counted inward with a simple pattern and returned to his breath when the count wanted to run. He felt the anchors as pressure and warmth and as a quiet promise that the next step would feel less like work and more like standing.

Rane watched the clock and the hands. She recorded the time each person touched a control because logs keep stories straight. She watched Joren's face and found resolve there. She would not turn that into poetry. She would turn it into schedules and assignments when the panel gave her permission.

Dax looked once at Hale and found that she was already looking at him. Neither smiled. Both allowed a small easing at the eyes. They stood their small distance, close enough to matter, far enough to keep the room clear.

Two hours became three because the panel liked what it saw and allowed a longer first cycle. Elias called the stop at precisely the mark he had written on his card because he respected his own rules when the tide of hope pushed him to ask for more. He lifted a hand. "Cycle off," he directed. "Lock anchors for integration."

The room softened by a degree. Joren exhaled a long breath and blinked against a brief sting at the corners of his eyes that surprised him more than anyone else. Kaela kept her hand steady and leaned in to speak where only he would hear.

"You carry yourself well," she offered, warm and plain. "We walk a little tomorrow in the room."

"Tomorrow," he agreed, with a steadier voice than he expected.

Elias stepped back and washed his hands. He dried them with the same care he had for years. He let his mind reach for the file that lived behind his ribs and then pulled it forward. The thanatium line would not enter their standard kits. That path belonged to those who bought youth like wine. This path belonged to a ship that worked. The permanent suite offered a clean structure. It gave him a model for Kaela that kept the vine climbing and left the ladder free. He would need more math and more hours and more careful words. He would give all three. He allowed himself one thought with color: the day when his daughter walked her counts with less weight would come closer if he kept his head now.

Rane tightened the strap at the bed rail with one careful pull and logged the end time. "You did your part," she told Joren, voice low. "We will do ours."

Colvern arrived at the door and read the room without stepping in. She took in faces, monitors, and the posture of a man who had chosen his next hours. She kept her words short and useful. "Captain approves the unit in principle," she relayed. "Formal order follows after the evening board. Hale and Dax begin training orientation at first shift. Joren rests today, begins short work tomorrow, and meets me on the third day for fit-for-duty planning."

Hale lifted a thumb from her thigh and placed it back with the smallest tap. "Understood," she voiced.

Dax met Joren's eyes. "I will bring that light pack," he reminded, a dry curl at the edge of the words.

"Bring two," Joren returned, breath calm now. "One for you when I pass mine off."

Kaela looked at Elias. He did not smile much. He allowed one now, small and real, then turned to the nurse and began the slow cadence of post-procedure checks. Hands moved. Pens wrote. The clock turned. The room did what rooms like this do when people let them: it held the work steady while a person built a new frame inside his skin.

When they wheeled Joren to recovery, Rane walked beside the bed. She did not touch the rail. She kept pace and counted the floor marks under her breath. The count matched the signal on the panel. It matched the breath from the bed. It matched the step of the woman who walked at the other side with her hand on the forearm of the man she loved. Duty made sense again. The ship felt like a place where plans carried weight because people carried weight.

Outside, the corridor returned to its regular sounds. Inside, a unit began to take shape with names that were already written on lockers and on pages that meant something. The map of their next hours looked clear enough to carry without fancy words. Hale would train. Dax would train. Joren would rest and then train. Rane would guard the line. Elias would write panels and keep his hopes quiet until the math agreed. Colvern would bring the captain a page that told the truth and kept fear out of the halls.

The ship kept time. The team kept count. The work continued.
