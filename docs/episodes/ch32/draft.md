Chapter 32 - Harrow Reach Briefing

The responder bay opened on first shift with the kind of light you use when you want hands to work clean: bright, even, no glare off metal. Crates sat open on the benches with foam tucked back. Harnesses hung on a rack in size runs. Beacon cases lay in a line next to the coil baskets. The new splice delivery units rested in charging cradles with seal tags still intact. Cooldown kits were clipped to a red board at chest height so you could grab one without looking down.

Aria Mbeki came in first and took a breath that smelled like solvent, cold steel, and the clean bite from new rubber. She wore her work shirt with sleeves to the elbow and a band around her braid. She tapped the callus at the base of her middle finger the way she always did before touching a fastener, then moved to the harness wall and lifted one to check the length of the chest strap. The buckles were smooth. The webbing had no fray. She turned the strap over once and nodded to herself.

Keon Alvarez walked in behind her with a coil of line over his shoulder and a finger wrapped where an old rope burn still barked on cold mornings. He set the coil in the basket, checked the lay of the first loop, and reached for the anchor kit. \"We have two full sets here,\" he observed, keeping his voice even while his hands kept moving through the checklist. \"Primary and spare are complete and ready, and the fairlead pins look new straight out of the bag.\"

"Good," Aria returned. "We will use both if the approach shifts."

Lysa Farouk crossed the threshold with a soft case in one hand and her med slate in the other. She took a stool, unzipped the case, and set her tools in order without fuss: a neck cooling strip in its foil, the metered nasal spray in a clear sleeve, a clip patch for tapering a coupler, and a small camera for after action photos. She aligned the syringes by habit and checked the expiration dates like a person counting aloud in her head.

Tomas Yao, the coupler systems technician, eased a handheld scanner onto the bench and lifted one of the new units from its cradle. He checked the serial against the manifest, read the triplex pre-fire indicator, and ran a low-power test that put a clean beep into the room. \"The triplex pre-fire sweep is active and reading clean right now,\" he reported, keeping the handheld on the unit as the indicators cycled.

"If the scanner detects any amber marker during that check, this coupler will refuse to arm or initiate under any circumstance. Dosage control is currently locked to clinic default ranges until we confirm operational profiles during the bench check and before issue."

Elian Rocha arrived last with a torque bar in his back pocket and gloves hooked to his belt. He palmed the bar, spun it once, and slid it back with the comfort of a man who knew exactly how much force his wrist made at each notch. He opened a plate kit, laid the shims out by thickness, and checked the teeth on a fresh cut wheel with his thumbnail.

Aria lifted a beacon from its case and checked the mount points with a careful thumb run along each bracket. \"Aria Mbeki, hull,\" she offered, making sure the new faces heard it from her directly and not by rumor later. \"Path lead and final anchor call, with responsibility for placement and sign-off under the mission clock.\"

\"Keon Alvarez, I am your rigger,\" Keon replied, as he set the fairlead on the table and rolled the pin once to feel the bore for grit. \"Line math and approach angles are mine, including snapback cones and load staging, and I keep the pull honest from start to finish.\"

\"Lysa Farouk, responder-medic,\" Lysa added, while clipping a cooldown kit to her belt and tightening the strap until her hand could find it blind. \"Abort thresholds and timers live with me, and I read vital signs, run the medical log, and pull the lever if anyone crosses a line.\"

\"Tomas Yao, coupler systems,\" Tomas introduced, eyes still on the diagnostic screen while the indicators cycled through their checks. \"I verify every fire with a clean scan, maintain all lockouts without exception, and keep dosage inside the posted usage limits for every window. \"If a unit balks or throws a questionable flag, I own the fix from first look to final confirmation.\"

\"Elian Rocha, structural fitter,\" Elian finished, opening a small case of gussets and laying them out by thickness to keep choices quick. \"I align plates and track torque across each fastener, I cut shims as needed, and I give the anchor a bite point it can trust under proof load.\"

Aria set the beacon back into its foam and reached for the printed board that held the limits in large, readable type. \"Base mesh windows remain short by design, with steady-hand support and grip stabilization, light reinforcement at hips and shoulders, and a modest oxygen push if the count runs long. \"No cognitive adjustments are permitted for this mission under any circumstance, and that includes narrow exceptions people like to invent under pressure. \"If a window overlaps by mistake and someone starts to climb beyond control, Lysa has cooldown authority on the spot without debate. \"Our anchor cue remains two shoulder squeezes and a slow number count, and we use it without argument whether pride is wounded or not.\"

Keon checked both harness leg loops for twist and length, then looked up after snugging the buckles to a consistent mark. \"Copy across the board,\" he confirmed, with a glance that promised compliance and not a negotiation for later.

Tomas lifted the coupler so everyone could see the status lights clearly and understand what green actually meant today. \"The triplex pre-fire sweep runs on every attempt, and it runs before any dose is permitted to leave the chamber,\" he explained, keeping the handheld on the unit while the indicators cycled. \"If an amber marker appears at any point in that check, the device will not arm or initiate, and no one on this team will bypass the lockout. \"I can run a manual confirmation when we suspect a false positive, but the timing boundary still holds until the handheld clears the alert in writing.\"

Lysa clicked the nasal spray back into its sleeve and settled the neck strip into an outer pocket so it would be first to hand. \"Abort thresholds for the room, once out loud so no one pretends they forgot them under stress,\" she continued, making eye contact across the semicircle. \"Any loss of recognition triggers an immediate stop, and any strike toward a teammate does the same without a second warning.\
\"Any tremor that fails to settle by ten seconds counts as a trigger, and any amber signal on a scope is treated as live until I clear it. \"Those events earn the cooldown kit and a stop-work order, and we remove the person if conditions permit or taper in place with a partner until they are steady.\"

Elian pulled on his gloves and flexed them fully, then unflexed to check that the seams lay flat and did not bite at the knuckles. \"I want eyes on the anchor metal as soon as we have a view, and I want a quiet minute to read the wear patterns before anyone loads it,\" he put in, planting that need early. \"If a bite point looks tired or poorly seated, I will cut a collar and a gusset on the spot, and I will need two minutes of clean hold while I seat and test it.\"

\"You will have that time without argument,\" Aria answered, while she clipped her harness, tightened the waist, and drove a finger under the strap to verify the fit. \"We are placing three beacons and setting one anchor in a debris field with intermittent EM noise and low light throughout our window. \"Timing will be tight and extraction windows will be brief, so we stick to process and we keep our bodies honest even when the job presses. \"No one earns points for finishing a count breathless when the work will wait for one more second, and no one buys speed by borrowing risk from the next hour.\"

Keon stacked two coils in the basket and set the spare kit on top. He glanced once at Aria, a flicker of last night passing across his face, then tucked it away without effort. The work in front of them asked for their full attention, and he had no trouble giving it.

Aria lifted her slate and took attendance by habit, one name at a time, one role at a time, a short pause after each to let the weight of the job settle where it belonged. When she looked up, the team stood ready: harnesses checked, cooldown clipped, tools counted, couplers sealed and green. The hatch to the prep corridor clicked and slid open. Cold light from the viewport washed across the bench tops, and the shapes of the debris field hung out there in slow motion, waiting for people who knew how to work inside a moving problem and not turn it into theater.

They suited in practiced order because routine keeps hands honest when minutes matter, and Aria set her harness, drew slack smooth through the waist, and checked for one finger of space so breath would not hitch under load. Keon clipped on his right hip, tugged twice, and tested his coil hand with a quick squeeze that settled nerves better than talk, while Tomas latched the coupler case to the frame, watched his handheld settle green, and gave a short nod that meant it would behave. Elian seated his gloves, flexed the seams flat, and holstered the torque bar so the handle sat where muscle memory expected it, and then the door crew cleared the lane and let them move.

The prep corridor stayed bright and cold so hardware read clean at a glance, and outside the viewport the debris field turned slow beyond a scatter of work lights that barely reached the far edge. Brant checked in from Tow Skiff Grey with pull available, drum primed, and comms clear, so Aria acknowledged and walked them through the hatch rather than burn time at a threshold. The airlock cycle gave thirty seconds for breath and heart to settle, the outer door opened on the service ladder and fixed safety line, and the first push out felt familiar: light foot touch, a steady pull at the tether, and the kind of working quiet that lets a plan take the front seat.

"Beacon one goes on the forward cluster," Aria briefed, using lamp cues to beat the electromagnetic noise while she kept her light tight to the work and the case at her hip. They took the long side to clear a thin screen by two meters, and Keon mirrored her line so the two tethers never crossed, keeping his choices simple with slack or pull and left or right instead of anything heroic. Tomas swept before any tool went live near a window and held his handheld steady for pre-fire, and when the pass read clean with no markers and defaults confirmed, Aria breathed through a count that steadied wrists and shoulders, locked her hands, and used finger pressure to extend so the arm would not wobble in the last inch.

The beacon crossed a clean meter and touched the plate with a soft click that carried through her tether like a wire. It seated and latched with that small movement you feel more than see when you have done this for years. Keon kept his line clear, floated the coil to her hip for stow, and watched her blind cone for floaters that like to sneak behind work. Tomas watched the indicator settle to a steady green and logged the placement without commentary. Aria checked the mount by light and by touch, marked it on the slate with a quick photo for angle and distance She let a small breath out when the readback stayed inside spec and the sight line to beacon two looked open for the next throw.

They crossed left on a slow line to read the anchor mass from twenty meters, and the target showed a broad face with grind scars that stopped short of the bite zone and edges clean enough to hold a collar without cutting the strap. "Elian, read me three points and call your collar width," Aria prompted, and he put gloved fingers on crown, shoulder, and lower right quadrant before calling a two-millimeter shim at the shoulder and a short collar for the dish. Cut approved, he worked the plate kit in steady strokes that wasted no motion, shims came out by thickness and went in by feel with short taps, and Aria held the tool bag open so he never had to fish blind while Tomas kept the scanner high to watch for interference spikes that could waste a minute at the worst time.

The collar seated and the bite face ran flush across the span, so Aria laid the strap, smoothed the lay, checked for hidden burrs, and pressed the hardware until the teeth took hold without a scrape that would come back to haunt them. Keon drifted wide to hold a clear cone and set the fairlead across his thigh while he rolled the pin to feel the bore, and he kept a snubber ready in case the angle tried to twist during proof. Aria checked her team with a quick sweep, raised her lamp for the mark, and called the start, and the tow answered with a feathered rise to ten percent that let the strap stretch, settle, and hold without a twitch. She read the face quiet at ten and asked Brant to advance on a slow ramp to twenty, Elian tracked torque marks with a finger to each fastener, Tomas logged tension as the numbers stepped up clean, and Keon watched the cone with a stillness that told Aria the anchor was doing exactly what it should.

They reached twenty percent and every gauge held steady, clean numbers stacking into a neat column. Pressure gathered in Aria's chest, a thin hiss threaded the comms, and heat rose inside her helmet. The repeater flickered, a shadow crossed high left, and the tether carried a fresh vibration. She drew breath to call a hold as a sharp ping rolled across the field. The debris field erupted at once, turning ordered work into moving hazards in a single breath. In all her years on the line, she had never seen a job swing sideways so fast.
