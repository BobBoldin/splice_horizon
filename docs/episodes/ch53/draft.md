**Chapter 53 --- Storm Rules**

The sun leaned west and pulled long shine across the flats. Heat pressed close. The pump hummed steady. Tanks climbed one mark at a time, while wind gusted and laid down without a pattern a farmer would trust. Rane walked the ring and watched the ridges where trouble likes to stage. Hale shadowed the console with her gloves warming to her pulse. Dax kept the tripod quiet behind the manifold and traced arcs across the skyline. Draeven set an optic on a post and drew a box around the approach line that made the most sense.

They arrived with a showman's flair. Three coats came first with badges that caught light. Two boys trailed them with spools and kites rolled tight on uprights. A fifth carried a sack the size of a helmet and a smile men wear when they think they own a room. The leader lifted a hand and pointed toward the pump.

"Fee visit," he opened, voice easy. "Plus weather management while you work."

Draeven stepped forward with the folder and a pace that carried time for thought. "Meridian draws under an interstellar water rights license," he replied. "We log flow, post numbers, and pay lawful invoices through a starport bank. The Compact reads clear on emergency extraction."

The man glanced at the boys with the spools. "We keep weather off your heads for a fair rate," he returned. "Watch the lesson."

One boy planted a carbon line on a ridge and fed the kite. The other boy wore a glove and a grin and watched the gust front build. He threw the kite at the peak of the wind. The line sang high. The sky cracked white. Lightning chased the carbon and smacked down fifty meters past the ring, hot and quick. Dust jumped. The pump frame thrummed through its bolts. Muniz swore once under his breath and checked a ground strap with steady fingers.

"Service with a sizzle," the leader quipped. He set the sack on the crust and pulled out a clear squeeze pack. "And chemistry, when mood swings more than you like." He dribbled a stream into a shallow pan of brine. The liquid gelled in seconds and turned to a wobble that kept shape when he poked it. "Brine gum likes pumps and hates filters."

Patel crouched, eyes sharp. "Cute trick," she judged. She lifted a small strip from her pocket and touched the gel. "We brought turbidity and color heads in the header. You will not poison our stream before we taste it."

The man smiled like a teacher who loves a bright pupil. "Best to pay for clean work and clean skies."

Rane raised the ship net and kept her voice even. "Director Veynar, on channel," she called. "Locals offer weather kites and hint at brine gum caches. They want extraction fees at their desk."

Veynar answered after one measured breath. "You keep those pumps running," he instructed. "Ordnance from orbit would end this quick and end our water rights faster. The exchange at Megnar stays on our ledger only if we keep the basin clean. Negotiate and record. We hold the law. We keep the tanks growing."

"Logged," Rane returned. She cut the line and turned to the leader. "We will pay at the starport office with a bank number that clears," she offered. "You bring that stamp to the table and we sign. Surcharges live in your story, not our book."

The man's smile did not change. "You like simple math," he judged. "We can honor that taste with a simple test. Double fee if you lose. Half fee if you win. You choose a champion. I bring a pair."

Hale worked her fingers inside the glove until the gel settled sweet under the knuckles. "Name your room," she answered. "Name your rules."

"Right here," the man decided, sweeping a hand to mark a square between beacons. "Hands and feet. No blades. No guns. No breaks for the wind. My pair finishes the round together."

Rane looked at Hale and saw calm in the posture and heat where heat belongs. "You carry the house," she allowed. "We film for the ledger. Draeven runs count. Halden holds med. Dax watches the horizon and keeps our people safe from the men with spools."

Two figures walked from behind the ridge as if the ground had grown them. Brothers by jaw and eye, wide across the chest, long through the limb. Seven feet if a fly favors dung and the ridge adds an inch. Skin glossed with salt. Necks built like stumps. Their hands hung heavy and open, and their feet dug the crust with each step as if they tested the plate for secrets.

"Local sons," the leader introduced. "They bring pride and practice."

Hale flexed once and rolled her shoulders until everything sat where it belonged. The gloves read her muscle twitch and preloaded the weave for block and strike. Impact gel pooled soft and waited to turn iron at contact. She stepped into the square with the look she carries when a room needs a new order. Draeven lifted a hand for start. The boys with kites moved back, but not far. Dax slid his foot to reset the tripod leg. Rane kept the leader in her eye line and logged his tells into memory.

Round one opened with a rush. The left brother cut in low with a paw for Hale's hip. The right brother faked high and tried to loop behind. Hale stepped through the middle. The gloves stiffened a half beat ahead of her wrist. She jammed the left arm, rode the force, and snapped a short hook to the ear that made the big head rock. She pivoted and drove a cross into the right chest where ribs wake up slow. The hit landed clean. He grunted and backed one pace, then smiled because he enjoyed work that fed his reputation.

They moved in patterns that read like a drill watched through heat. The brothers used one mind and four hands. When one reached, the other trapped. When one ducked, the other covered. Hale used small circles and short lines. She slid inside strikes, checked wrists with bone, and brought knuckles to nerve points that teach respect. She tapped a temple, touched a throat, kissed a liver. The gloves did their job. Pain colored both faces. Pride carried both men forward.

Round two thumped heavy. The left brother drove a forearm into Hale's guard and leaned weight until crust ground under boots. The right brother tried a neck wrap with a grip that would pull a fence post loose. Hale dropped, spun, and freed her head, then rose with a shoulder strike that put him on his heels. She lifted a knee into his thigh and felt the big muscle twitch. He grimaced, then laughed because he lived for this. Sand skittered across the square as wind eddied.

The leader clapped once, slow, like a man enjoying music without buying a ticket. "Half fee sits close," he judged, tone mild.

Round three brought dirty tricks. The right brother palmed salt and threw it at eye height. Hale turned her face and let the grit streak across her brow without blinding her. The left brother used the beat to step through and tie her arm. Hale dropped her weight, locked her wrist to her hip, and rolled. They hit crust and bounced. She came up with her arm free and a bruise waking along her ribs. Her heart stayed level. She exhaled with her hands.

Draeven's count tapped in her ear. "Work small," he counseled. "Take the space they give you. Use the gloves like a carpenter uses a mallet."

Round four strained edges. The brothers tightened their timing. They pinballed her between bulk and grip. Hale turned their mass against them, but gravity loves weight, and the flat gave them room to press. She ached where old fights left notes. She kept balance. She took two shots to the back that made her legs warm with anger. She aimed that heat at the right targets.

The boys with spools let their lines lift, casual as birds feeding. Wind built with a promise. Rane flicked fingers at Dax. He stepped to the mast he and Halden had grounded before lunch and clipped the bond strap. Lightning found the mast and blew through the strap to the screws with a crack that made hearts skip one beat. The pump kept humming. The ring kept working. The brothers kept swinging.

Round five tipped hard. The left brother jammed her shoulder with the heel of his hand and rode force to a clinch. The right brother found her waist and locked hands around her belt line. They worked like a press. Hale's boots skated a half step. She set a heel, set her hips, and brought her head forward into the bridge of the nearest nose. Bone met bone. He blinked hard and tasted salt. She hammered two body shots into the other one's ribs, then dropped her level and shook her hips free. The gloves stiffened on instinct and turned the exit clean.

The leader leaned an inch toward the square. "Best hour on these flats in months," he remarked. "I like a woman who fights with sense."

Hale heard him, filed it, and stayed on the work. She felt her breath where it belonged and kept it. She felt the gel under her knuckles and trusted it. She tracked the brothers' timing and saw it, at last, as lines she could cut.

Round six broke open. The right brother overreached with a hook as the left brother dove for Hale's legs. She stepped along the line between them and fed the right glove into the hook at the wrist, hard, turning the joint and stealing force. At the same beat, she stamped the left brother's instep with her heel and lifted her knee across his jaw. He reeled. She pivoted around his shoulder and took his back for one breath, then slid away before the second brother's counter could land. She threw two short shots into the solar plexus where breath lives. He folded and took a knee without shame.

The left brother roared and charged. She slipped, hooked his ankle with the side of her boot, and fed him the crust with a push that started at her hips and ended at his chest. He rolled, came up red-faced, and wiped salt from his eyes with a hand that finally read the day.

"Count," Draeven called, voice level. "Stand and show hands."

Both men stood. Both men showed hands. Both men smiled because a good fight pays a different kind of bill. Hale lifted her gloves and let them soften. Her ribs hurt. Her forearms tingled from blocks that had eaten real weight. Her jaw throbbed where an elbow had grazed. She breathed the pain into the place where she keeps earned aches.

"Call it," Rane prompted.

The leader looked at his brothers and saw pride, fatigue, and a respect that had not lived in their eyes when they walked in. He tipped his chin. "Half fee," he ruled. "You run clean, you run brave, and you keep your ring tidy. We like tidy."

Dax kept the tripod pointed at sky and ridge and let his shoulders ease one notch. Halden stepped in with a bottle, a quick look at Hale's pupils, and a hand under her elbow, then let go when Hale straightened. Joren pulled a rag from his pocket and cleaned grit from the header gauge, because habits write legacy as much as victories.

Rane held her slate up to the camera. "Agreement on record," she confirmed. "Half fee through starport escrow. No brine gum near our intake. Lightning masts stand on our bond, not yours. We exchange water for three local clinics at noon every day we draw. Those gallons equal your goodwill on paper and on the ground."

The leader rolled the squeeze pack in his fingers as if it were a coin. "You keep numbers honest," he allowed. "We keep boys off your hose. We like money that shows up where it belongs."

Patel stepped to the pan of gel and capped it with a jar that would ride topside for tests. "We log your trick as a local hazard," she informed, voice polite. "We write the counter into our plan. We pay our fee in a way a bank respects. That keeps more work coming to your basin."

The man's mouth twitched. "Bring tools, pay bills, tell no lies," he summed. "The edge honors that creed." He pointed at the boys with spools. "Pack it. The sky gets hungry again in an hour."

They turned without drama and walked back up the ridge. The brothers glanced once at Hale with something like a promise to return when the next festival needed a headline. She looked back and gave them a small nod that carried respect and a reminder that craft beats size when craft trains every day.

Rane breathed once, then twice. "Back to work," she called. "Dax, test the bond one more time before the gust front hits. Draeven, walk the stakes and check tape. Joren, run the header pins and then drink. Halden, salt tabs down the line. Patel, time the strainers and swap when flow drops more than five percent."

Hale touched the pump console with two fingers and felt the vibration through the glove. The gel cooled back to soft. The weave eased. Her hands felt like her hands again. She tasted iron at the back of her throat and let it pass. The tank gauge climbed one mark and then another, slow, steady, honest.

Up in orbit, Veynar logged the agreement into the starport registry and wrote a short note that kept ordnance parked and lawyers awake. Meridian held position and counted gallons. The flats breathed wind and heat and a little relief. The Wardens stood their line, worked their plan, and let a storm roll closer without ceding a meter of ring.

Sundown threw amber across the brine. Pumps kept their tone. Kites stayed furled. The beacons blinked in order like lights on a good ladder. Work kept moving, which counts as victory on days that force men to fight and count at the same hour.
