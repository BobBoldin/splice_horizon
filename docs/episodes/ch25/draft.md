Chapter 25 - For Kaela

Kaela worked at the bench with her sleeves tied back and a clear visor over her eyes. She labeled two trays: blood moths on the left, gravemite husks on the right. The blood moths showed dark veins through the wings and a thin film along the edges where dust held fast. The husks felt dry and chalky through gloves. She cut a line across the first shell, lifted a flap with fine forceps, and set the fragment on a slide. The scope gave her clean planes and tight edges. She named what she saw without trying to sound older than she was.

"Segmentation is regular," she said. "No live tissue. Mineral load sits high. Likely old shed."

Elias stood two stations away with a logboard and a pencil he had worn down to a stub. He watched her eyes as much as he watched the samples. She had a way of blinking that meant fatigue was moving in and a way of touching the corner of her jaw when her head hurt. He had not seen either in months. He saw both today. The ache showed first. The blink came after.

He kept his tone even. "Break when you need it."

"I am fine," she said. She adjusted the scope and kept working. "Husk two has a white seam. It looks like a calcium line. I want a pH test."

He passed her the strip and set a small timer where they both could see it. The lab smelled like alcohol wipes and clean dust. The air felt a little dry because the vents in this wing kept filters in a conservative mode. He told himself the dryness, not the work, was why her head hurt.

Kaela moved to the blood moth tray. She took a wing with clean edges and slid it under the lens. The veins divided into smaller lines that did not break until near the tip. The pattern looked like branches in winter. She did not say that. She called the lines what they were and wrote numbers. She pinched her nose once and stopped herself fast, as if she had broken a rule.

"Headache?" Elias asked.

"A small one," she said. She tried to smile and did not make herself finish it. "I can finish the moths."

He watched the way she held her shoulders. A small tremor came through when she reached for a new slide. It was not dramatic. It was real. He closed his logboard and stood at her station. "We are done for now."

She looked up, then down, then back up again. "You said we needed counts today."

"We did," he said. "We have enough." He kept his hands at his sides because he wanted to touch her shoulder and he did not trust his own face. "Sit. Breathe. Drink water."

She followed the instructions because she had learned that rules in a lab often meant safety first, not control for its own sake. She drank. She kept the visor down so she would not rub her eyes.

He saw the small lines at the edge of her mouth and the faint color high on her cheeks that said a headache could grow. He thought about baselines. He thought about Sunfan. He had said no for a year because even a small side effect had felt like too much to ask from his daughter. Liora had tolerated the baseline with only a dry mouth and a little sleep trouble after the first few weeks. Kaela might do as well. He could not make himself say yes. He could not make himself say no for long if the pain stayed.

"Stop for today," he said. "We will pick this up tomorrow."

She cleaned the bench with measured movements and put each tool back in its spot. She never rushed this part. That steadiness was her mother's gift. Liora had always said that order keeps a family from breaking when the day tries to split it.

Kaela lifted the visor and rubbed her temples with two careful circles. "I will rest," she said. "I will be fine."

He watched her leave the lab and turn down the hall toward quarters. Her gait stayed straight. The hand came up once to press the side of her head. He closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them and looked at the bench she had left. Blood moth wings lay in a clean fan. The husks sat in labeled rows. He cleaned the rest of the station himself, not because she had missed anything but because his hands needed work.

He walked to the medical bay with the key in his fist. The room had the lights he preferred for thinking. He opened the cabinet, brought out the lockbox, and set it on the tray. He did not look away from it. He unlatched it and lifted the lid. Two ampoules sat in their slots. The known stimulant on the left. The intelligence splice on the right. He had named the left one harmless and the right one necessary only in a world where no other path existed. He did not live in that world. He lived in this one.

He wrote in the ledger because he needed to see the choice in words before he made it in his blood. **Goal: remove or reduce side effects at baseline. Target: cognitive lattice speed sufficient to solve drift models and side-effect chains without new harm. Constraint: Article Twelve and consent law. Personal constraint: my daughter.**

He read the last line again. He waited for it to stop him. It did not. He took the right-hand ampoule and the sterile set and drew a micro-dose. He did not set up a second observer. He did not trigger the monitor to record a consent note. He told himself that this was a short act, with low risk, in service of patients who would never meet him. He knew that he was also doing it for Kaela.

He slid the needle into the line at his wrist. The first seconds passed without change. Then the room sharpened. Lines on the ledger stood up like ridges. He felt circuits in his head find shorter routes. Thoughts that usually took three steps took one. He tasted metal at the back of his tongue and told himself it was a harmless marker. He felt the small tremor move across his hands and then stop. He exhaled and heard the breath as if someone else had taken it.

He wrote while the window held. He pulled problems apart as if they were racks laid out for inspection. **Sunfan baseline: adjust timing to precede sleep by three hours, cut rebound by half with staged cooling. Platelet surge: use split dose with buffer saline, delay cascade. Headache: magnesium prime, avoid stimulant overlap. Nausea: protein timing with slow sugar, cut fat.** He tracked drift chains and circled the links where small pushes would change outcomes. He saw patterns and felt a heat in his chest that he called hope because he could not call it anything else.

A second surge came without warning. The room tilted. He was not dizzy. He was flooded. The models in his head linked beyond what he had asked them to do. He saw a path from blood moth dust to an enzyme in the gravemite shell that might bind the micro-plates and keep them from scarring. He saw a path from that enzyme to the way Sunfan changes heat load across a night. He spoke the steps out loud so he would not lose them. He reached for the ledger and wrote fast enough to tear the paper.

He felt the window close. Cold moved into his hands. He capped the syringe, slid the ampoule back into its slot, closed the lockbox, and turned the key twice. He put the box back in the cabinet and shut the door. He took one step toward the sink for water and his knee gave. He caught the tray, missed the second step, and hit the floor on his shoulder and hip. He lay still and counted his breaths until the room stopped pulling at his eyes.

At quarters, Liora set a mug on the table and watched Kaela rub her temple. "You are going to bed," she said. "No arguments."

"It will pass," Kaela said. "I will lie down."

Liora walked her to the bunk, checked the visor marks at her hairline, and felt the small heat on her skin that said the headache might linger. She waited until Kaela slept, then looked at the time. Elias should have come home by now. She sent a short message and watched it sit. She waited five minutes and sent another. She put on a jacket and left.

The medical bay door stood on ready. Liora called his name and heard nothing. She stepped inside and scanned the room the way a person does when they expect a mess and find only order. Elias lay on his side near the tray with one hand under his head and one on his chest. His eyes opened when she touched his shoulder. He focused slowly and found her face.

"I am all right," he said. The lie was small and tried to be kind. "Too many hours."

She checked his pupils, pressed along the clavicle, and then helped him sit. His hands shook once. He steadied them on the tray, then let her lift him to his feet. She glanced around the room because habit told her to. Cabinets were shut. Instruments were capped. The ledger lay open to a page that held tight lines about baselines and side effect chains. Nothing else was out of place.

"Home," she said. "Now."

He did not argue. The walk down the corridor took longer than it should have. He kept his balance after the second turn. She watched his face in profile and let the silence do the work of a thousand questions. At the door to quarters she paused with her hand on the panel.

"Exhaustion," she said, as if entering it on a chart. "That is what I am going to believe until you tell me different."

He nodded once. "Exhaustion."

Kaela woke when the door closed. She sat up and saw him lean on the table while her Mother poured water. She crossed the room and put a hand on his sleeve. "Looks like someone doesn\'t listen to their own advice," she said. "You do not take breaks when you should."

"I will now," he said. He meant it in that moment and knew plans made after a fall are not the same as plans kept next week.

Kaela searched his face and then let the worry shift to a lighter thing. "Sleep," she said. "I think we both need more than we care to admit."

He let Liora guide him to their bed and set a blanket. He felt the pull of sleep and let it have him. The ledger waited in the medical bay with pages he had filled under a borrowed brightness. He did not know if the work would stand in the morning. He only knew that Kaela did not ask the question he feared, and the lockbox key felt heavy against his chest in a way he could carry for now. He did not know what the dose had cost. He let the question hang; it would not be answered tonight.
