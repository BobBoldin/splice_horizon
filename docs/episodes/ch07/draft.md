Chapter 07 -- Consent Tribunal

"Morning in the Tribunal chamber, where voices carry and the light falls clean through high panels."

Benches faced a low dais with three seats. The room smelled faintly of paper and polished wood. On the left, a small cluster of families spoke in low tones with a **Patient Advocate** in a slate jacket. On the right, two Wardens stood near the wall, hands folded, eyes down.

The **Presiding Arbiter** lifted a palm. "This hearing is in session," he said. "Consent and selection for Phase-Beta. We will hear from the Advocate, from Medical, and from petitioner families. We acknowledge the incident in P D three at first bell and will account for it in today's scope."

The Advocate stepped forward. She kept one hand on a thin folder and the other open, steady at her side. "Ilya Serano, Patient Advocacy," she said. "I confirm that counseling packets went to all families present. I confirm that revocation rights were stated in plain words. I confirm a twenty-four hour cooling period for any new consent signed today."

"Thank you," the Arbiter said. "Doctor Tharros."

Elias came to the central stand with his shoulders square and his voice measured. "Medical proposes a narrow Phase-Beta," he said. "Indication is mid-stage Spiral with documented failure of current therapies. We propose five patients in the first cohort, one at a time, with forty-eight hours of continuous observation after the splice."

"What did you learn from the Sunfan specimen collected yesterday," the Arbiter asked.

"We observed a responsive underlayer at whisper tone," Elias said. "The response lowered resistance to flow on a test bed. The specimen later became unstable in cold room. Neutralization followed protocol. We will not use data from the unstable period in any human planning. We have sufficient Phase-Alpha modeling to proceed on a limited basis."

The Advocate lifted her folder. "For the record," she said, "I request that the Tribunal bind Medical to the narrow indication and to an outside observer during every Beta prep."

"Bound," the Arbiter said. "We will mark those terms."

He turned to the families. "We now address selection. Volunteer priority stands. The shortfall clause may only trigger if the target number cannot be met in the quarter and after Advocate review. Today we have three volunteers and two open slots. If volunteers remain short by the last week of the quarter, **one adult per household per year** may be called by lottery. The lottery is subject to medical screening, Advocate presence, and right of appeal."

A woman with a woven scarf stepped forward with her partner. She held a slate with both hands and kept her chin level. "Maris Delane," she said. "I volunteer. I am mid-stage. I have read the packet twice."

The Advocate stood with her. "I have counseled Maris," she said. "She understands the risks. She repeats them back without coaching. She is not signing under pressure."

"Doctor Tharros," the Arbiter said. "Is Maris within your proposed indication."

"Yes," Elias said. "Her labs and course qualify."

"Maris Delane," the Arbiter said, "do you understand that Phase-Beta is first-in-human. Do you understand that benefit is unknown."

"I do," Maris said. "I understand the risk. I also understand the math if we keep waiting."

"Very well," the Arbiter said. "Your consent, if signed, will start a cooling period of twenty-four hours. You may revoke before prep. Advocate Serano will remain your witness."

He looked to the room. "We have two remaining slots and two additional volunteers present for screening. If those do not hold, the shortfall clause will be discussed at the end of the week. I will read the clause in plain words for those who are new to this room."

He read from a printed sheet. "When the quarter ends short of needed participants and no additional volunteers qualify, the Continuance Charter permits a draw of **one adult per household per year**. Exclusions apply to minors, to those with critical medical exemptions, and to holders of essential duty posts under alert. The Advocate will verify that the call is lawful and humane. Any called person may appeal to this Tribunal. No household may be called twice in a year."

A murmur moved through the benches and then quieted.

The Arbiter nodded to Ilya. "Counsel the room," he said.

Ilya faced the families and spoke like someone who had spent years making sharp things round enough to hold. "If you plan to volunteer, you will sit with me after this session," she said. "I will ask what you fear, and what you hope for. I will ask what you want us to do if you change your mind on the table. I will write it down. If the shortfall clause concerns you, I will explain the appeal. No one signs without privacy and time."

She turned to Elias. "Doctor, state the phases for the room."

"Phase-Alpha," Elias said, "means we stay inside the lab. We use a **lattice loom** to run plate patterns on a scaffold. We test tiny pieces with a **micro-coupler**, a wand that encourages a join at a very small scale. No human subjects. No bedside work."

"Phase-Beta," he went on, "means first-in-human. We build a **graft matrix**, a soft scaffold seeded with the patient's cells. We place Sunfan filaments on that matrix and we use the **micro-coupler** to invite a join. If it holds, we see an **integration lattice**, which is the network that ties host and graft together. We monitor for forty-eight hours in the Lattice Suite. The Advocate observes the consent and the prep."

A panelist leaned toward his mic. "Yesterday's incident in P D three," he said. "Does it change your plan today."

"It changes our attention," Elias said. "The plan stays narrow. We pause any use of yesterday's late data until the review is complete."

The Arbiter lifted his palm. "Here is the ruling," he said. "The Tribunal grants a conditional green for Phase-Beta on a cohort of five, one at a time, with Advocate oversight in prep and continuous monitoring. We bind Medical to the narrow indication described. We bind the quarter's shortfall discussion to the last week, and we bind any draw to full screening and appeal. The lab incident review will be recorded before the second patient proceeds."

He struck the small chime. The sound was thin and final.

Ilya turned to Maris and spoke in a voice that respected a person's daylight. "We will find a quiet room," she said. "We will go through every page. If any part feels wrong in your mouth, you will say so."

Maris nodded and held her partner's hand. "I will say it," she said.

Elias stepped back from the stand. The chamber's air tasted like paper and a little like metal. He could feel yesterday's loss sitting at the edge of the room, polite and present. He did not look for it. He followed the Advocate and the family to the side door where the light fell softer and the walls were close enough to listen.

"Evening at the observation ring, where the glass curves so wide the ship feels small."

The public chime sounded twice. Conversations paused. A child pointed at the ceiling as if the sound might draw pictures. The lights dimmed by a shade and the stars grew teeth in the dark.

"Attention," the channel said in the calm voice people trusted. "Navigation speaking. We are entering the Thalen Cluster. Approach to candidate world Orivay in four minutes. Public view is active."

People came without being asked. The rail filled with hands, some rough, some small. The floor hummed a little higher as if the ship had found a new note to sing. Joren slid in at Kaela's side and angled his shoulder so she had room. Liora sat on a bench with her feet under her and her palms open on her knees. She watched the glass like a person about to hear a favorite song.

Nyra leaned forward until the world filled her. "Dust lanes at two o clock," she said, not for show, just because names were a way to let others see. "Blue white scatter. There is a fat band out there that will make the next hour look like a dream."

Kaela smiled at the words and then at the sight that followed them. The black softened into a faint river of light, then brightened until it looked like ground made of stars. In the middle of it, a pin sharpened and grew. It wore a thin ring like a thought around a head.

"Orivay," the channel said. "Preliminary read. Atmosphere is oxygen poor but non-toxic. Nitrogen base with argon trace. No corrosive aerosols. No lethal radiation spikes. Surface bands in temperate range. Suit use is required for first step. Survey window opens at first light."

Murmur ran along the rail and then broke into quiet laughter in three places at once. The planet turned and threw a line of green along one side where storm and forest met in a long, pale seam. Water lit like a mirror and then went dark when cloud crossed it.

Draeven reached the rail and stood a half step behind the crowd with his hands clasped. He watched the faces first and the world second. Security did its slow scan of the room and then did it again because the body likes to have a job when the heart is busy.

Mira arrived in a clean jacket with tape still at one wrist. She stopped two paces from the glass, took in a breath as if the air had flavor, and let it go in a way that sounded like relief.

Elias stood beside her. He carried nothing. No slate, no pen. He let his eyes rest on the green and the cloud and the light. The lines on his face remained, and their meaning changed.

Joren leaned close enough for his sleeve to touch Kaela's. "It looks like a promise," he said.

Kaela nodded. "It looks like a place where wind smells like leaves," she said. "Even if the first wind we feel is through a filter."

Nyra tilted her head and listened to the pitch of the ship under the crowd. "Navigation just trimmed our path," she said. "Hear that lower hum. That is us saying hello without words."

The public channel returned. "Council speaking. We will schedule a first survey at first light. Captain Draeven will lead. Survey team will post at the rail in five minutes."

Draeven stepped forward with a small pad that looked more like a courtesy than a need. He did not raise his voice. He waited for the chatter to dip and then he spoke the names.

"Rhea Halden," he said. "Dax Rovell. Nyra Solwyn. Geo tech Renn Afolu. Medical tech Mira Jeylan if I can steal her, or Tamsin Vorel if I cannot."

Mira looked up at her name and lifted a hand with a half smile. "You can steal me," she said. "I owe the day something better than paperwork."

Draeven nodded. "Doctor Tharros will remain on comms," he said. "Wardens will set the bay. Decon will hold the door."

Liora tipped her head toward Elias without looking at him. "You will try to sleep," she said. "You will not pretend to succeed."

"I will try," Elias said, and the simple truth in it let the moment be kind.

A child near the rail pressed both hands to the glass and whispered, "Hello," as if the planet might be close enough to hear a small word. The word fogged a circle and then faded.

Joren lowered his voice. "Will you be on the launch deck," he asked Kaela. "Or will you watch from here."

"I will stay by the rail," Kaela said. "If they close the bay, I will watch from the ring."

Joren nodded. "I will find you after. I will tell you what I saw."

She smiled. "Bring me a short clip if you can, and one detail the clip will miss."

Nyra checked her slate out of habit and then put it away because the world in front of her did not need a filter tonight. Paxen drifted near the back and stayed out of the way, hands in pockets, gaze steady. When Nyra glanced over, he gave the smallest nod, as if to say, I am happy you will see it first.

"Attention," the channel said. "Survey briefing in five minutes on Procurement Deck One. Crew only."

The crowd made room without being told. The rail thinned and thickened as people left and others took their place. The planet turned and showed a string of islands like beads on a line. Cloud curled along a gulf. Light lifted on the far edge and made a thin blade at the rim.

Draeven touched Halden's shoulder as he passed. "Steady hands," he said.

"Always," she said.

He touched Dax's forearm next. "Eyes on your work," he said. "Chase two rabbits, catch none."

Dax's grin stopped at the right place. "One rabbit," he said. "I have it."

Nyra reached into her pocket and found the thin red thread she kept for maps. She did not use it. She let it lie there like a promise she would keep later when it was time to pin a path.

Mira exhaled once more and looked to Elias. "I will pack a small kit," she said. "Simple draws, air sniffs, basic touch plates. Nothing that will make the day heavy."

"Good," Elias said. "Keep it light. Bring back what answers to kindness."

He meant the words and she let that be enough.

Kaela looked from the glass to her father and saw a change in his face unseen for many months. Ease had no place on this ship. What she saw was a softer gear, a kind of readiness that eased the strain.

She lifted a hand to Joren. "Go," she said. "Deliver what needs to be delivered. Then come back and tell me what water looks like when it belongs to a horizon."

"I will," he said. He took a step, then came back the half step and lowered his voice. "And I will count three breaths before I say anything loud."

"Good," she said, and smiled in a way that let him feel clever for the thought.

The public chime sounded again, not urgent, just useful. "Briefing now," the channel said.

The rail gave up a line of bodies that moved with purpose. The room kept its soft noise for those who stayed. Orivay turned, slow and patient, like a person who will let you look as long as you need.

"Later, on Procurement Deck One, where the bay smells like clean metal and the floor hums."

Draeven stood at the chalk circle with a clean sheet pinned to the board. The lander behind him wore a shine that said it had been checked by a person who took pride in bolts that lined up. The name along its side read **Kestrel Twelve**, a little private joke for a craft that would never skim a ring.

"We will keep this short," Draeven said. "We bring a small kit and a wide mind. Halden, Dax, Nyra, Renn, Mira. You will see for yourselves. The rest of us will see through you."

He tapped the board. "Orivay reads as non-toxic, but we will treat it like any stranger. Suits on the first step. We test air at knee height and heart height. We look and listen before we collect. We mark our path and we do not hurry."

He let the words sit. No one needed more.

"Questions," he asked.

"Only one," Nyra said. "Do we have time to be glad on the way down."

Draeven's mouth turned at the edge. "Yes," he said. "Be glad. Keep your hands steady while you are doing it."

"Understood," Nyra said.

Mira checked a small case no larger than a lunch tray. "I will carry this and nothing larger," she said. "Sample pods, touch plates, air sniffs, and a small kit to collect a surface scrape if we need a mineral sample."

"Approved," Draeven said.

Dax looked at Halden and spoke low, more to her than to the room. "I have the landing, but if you see me get greedy, you will say the word."

"I will say the word," Halden said. "You will hear it."

Elias lifted a small mic. He did not step into the circle. "I will be on comms," he said. "I will be on comms, listening. If I need a sample flagged, I will call it. Otherwise, collect what looks useful and keep notes."

Draeven nodded once. "Suits at the rack," he said. "First light is soon. Let us make this clean."

They broke. Buckles clicked. Fabric whispered. The lander opened its mouth and showed a neat throat of seats and straps and space for small hope. The bay doors rested with their own patience, ready to breathe out when told.

Orivay turned beyond the hull, green and cloud and water and stone, waiting without knowing it was being waited for. The Meridian adjusted her path by a hair and the floor told everyone who could feel it that morning was coming.
