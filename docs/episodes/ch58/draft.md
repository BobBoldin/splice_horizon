Chapter 58: The Trace

By midday the bait order cleared the last clerk without a question. The requisition packet moved under a routine code with a modest quantity and a batch number that matched the clinic's ask. Draeven initialed the transit note, closed the folder, and gave the team one line: "We watch, we do not wave."

Hale took a steward to the bonded lanes and walked the cameras in person. She stood at each post, checked the angle, and logged the timestamp drift with a pocket clock. The lenses displayed clean glass and steady frames. Two showed a narrow blind spot where a catwalk shadow touched the lane at high sun. She marked those for coverage later and moved on.

Joren ran clock audits against last week's delays. Three bays showed a slow minute on the hour. The variance carried through to their lane assignments. He circled each one and wrote a short note for operations: "Calibrate or set a red tag. False windows invite theft."

Colvern kept a quiet line open to two stewards who valued facts over speeches. She asked for weigh tickets for the day the Earth clinic received the suspect lot. The steward sent scans within the hour. Two tickets matched. One showed a pallet weight that fit the manifest yet sat five kilos heavy for the listed fittings. She flagged it and filed the image in a folder marked "close look."

Elias called with a short update. The shuttered plant's tooling ledger listed three press dies as "scrapped on site" the week before closure. The scrap yard receipt used a generic description. The signature belonged to a shift foreman who later registered a shell company that never filed tax at year one. Elias did not call it proof. He logged it as a path.

Mira pulled reports on the efficiency bump from three clinics in different cities. The gains aligned within half a percent across similar use cases. She marked each with time, dose, and patient profile. She wrote a single line at the top of the page: "Demand will track rumor."

Dax watched the bait packet from a dark console with two screens. The tracer beacon sat three layers deep in the digital jacket. If a siphon routed the request through a private desk, the packet would pulse once and stamp a location. If a clerk only viewed the top page, nothing moved. He zoomed out, checked the network map, and set a timer to chirp every hour.

The custody chain did not break that afternoon. It did not need to. This kind of work rewarded patience and punished noise. Draeven ran the ship steady at Megnar, kept the water schedule clean, and refused any inspection tour that smelled like theater. He wanted the Custodian bored enough to keep his routine.

At shift change, a message arrived from the bonded warehouse office: camera three on the service lift had logged a brief snow at 13:17 and recovered by 13:19. The note used plain words and no excuse. Hale walked the corridor to the lift and checked the junction box with a light. The cover screws showed fresh tool marks. A tag in the corner listed a maintenance order that did not exist in operations. She stood long enough to mark the exact height of a hand that would loosen a panel in a hurry, then photographed the label and returned to the map room.

"Someone rehearsed a mask," she reported. "Two minutes. Short enough to pass as a reset. Long enough to move a crate from one mark to another."

Colvern paired Hale's photo with the false maintenance number and sent a quiet ask to the steward: "Confirm ticket origin. No penalties. We need the clerk name." The reply came back: no such ticket, no such clerk on that desk today.

The first ping hit at 18:06. Dax did not cheer. He wrote the coordinate on a pad and traced it across the port overlay. The packet had hopped from the public desk to a side terminal in a records room with no service window. The terminal belonged to a contractor batch account that should only clear holds. It had no reason to touch a clinic restock.

"Hooked," Dax observed. "Records room pulled the packet for two minutes and pushed it back to the public lane. Someone took a look under the jacket and then played dumb."

"Copy the logs and lock them down," Draeven returned. "No chatter outside this room."

Joren overlaid the records room door camera and rolled the clip. A man in a grey vest used a key tag to enter at 18:04, stood at a terminal, and left at 18:07 with a manila folder under his arm. The key tag belonged to a temp whose contract had expired last month. The face matched a clerk who had never been assigned to that room.

Colvern breathed once, slow. "We have the siphon point," she concluded. "We still need the lane where product moves, not paper. Next step is weight."

Hale had already requested pallet scales for two suspect bays. Operations dragged their feet until she offered three sentences about insurance, inspection stamps, and who signed a release when a crate pinched a loader. The scales arrived before midnight. Each posted a tare and a simple green circle when set.

Mira handed Draeven a short printout. "Clinic A has a patient with elevated response to this batch," she warned. "They will request more within the week. We should decide whether to let that request run free or divert it to our bait clinic."

Draeven weighed it. "Let it run," he decided. "We need real demand to pull the network taut. If we divert every ask, the Custodian smells a hand in the line."

At 01:22, the packet pulsed again. This time it bounced off the bonded lane router and detoured to an office labeled "voucher reconciliation." The office did not process pharmacy stock. It balanced crate counts and printed flags for missing numbers. The terminal took a thirty-second peek and released the file with no changes.

"Second look, new desk," Dax recorded. "Same pattern: touch the jacket, do not leave a mark."

Joren mapped the touches on the board as small red dots. "If this keeps up, we will get a chain of review desks the Custodian uses to watch for tasty orders," he predicted. "He will only grab those that match his risk model: just big enough to matter, not big enough to trigger a steward."

Colvern scratched out a fresh list: records room, reconciliation office, and the service lift with the two-minute snow. She underlined the lift and wrote: "crate in motion here."

Elias chimed back with a new piece: the foreman with the scrap signature had a nephew who took a short contract two cycles ago in the bonded warehouse---three weeks on nights, one week paid cash. The nephew's temp badge had never been returned. Elias sent a low-resolution image. The face looked like the man in the grey vest caught by the records room camera.

They did not cheer at that either. They put the image next to the board and circled the badge number. The line from the dead plant's die to a bonded office on Megnar did not prove the owner of the hand. It proved the existence of the hand. That was enough for tonight.

Draeven closed the room at 02:10. "Sleep in shifts," he ordered. "Hale, keep the scales. Dax, watch the network. Joren, finish the clock audit and hand it to operations at eight. Colvern, prep a narrow brief for two stewards only. Mira, tell Elias which three clinics to watch for follow-on requests and set a polite stall if a case feels unsafe."

The ship settled into the kind of quiet that holds after a long day. Pumps on Megnar would start before sun. The bait packet would swim through the port's pipes and maybe, finally, slide into the net they set without a flare.

At 06:43 the records room camera caught another entrance. Same face. New folder. The terminal woke, the badge registered, and the screen displayed a split view: clinic order on one side, a private code window on the other. A cursor blinked. The clerk typed four characters, waited, then typed two more. The window closed. The order flowed back to the public lane.

"Signal word," Dax judged. "He tags a packet that matches their profile, then alerts a desk that will do the actual pull."

"Which desk," Hale asked.

"Service lift," Joren answered, tapping the board. "Two minutes is enough to move a crate if the dock side is prepped."

Colvern drafted a new request to operations: "Authorize a surprise proof on lift seal integrity for cameras three and four. Use the word insurance." The permission came back in six minutes with a friendly note: "Be our guest."

By midmorning the scales picked up two pallets that matched weight inside tolerance and one that registered heavy by four kilos against manifest. Hale logged the number and kept her voice level when the dock boss asked whether the green circle meant good. "It means the scale works," she returned. "Run your lifts."

Draeven stood at the window of the map room and watched the port lanes from a distance. The day looked like any other: loaders in blue caps, clerks with bands, a steward with a book under his arm. On the far side, a barge nosed in with a blunt bow and a tired horn. Nothing in that picture carried a label that read break. He did not need a label. He needed time and proof.

The ping that followed did more than pulse. It **latched**, a brief handshake from a private router in a room with no posted function. The name on the network table used a housekeeping code. Housekeeping had no reason to route clinic stock.

"Mark it and do not touch it," Draeven ordered. "We move people, not alerts. Hale, keep your eyes outside. Colvern, walk a steward past that hallway for a 'routine' fire extinguisher check. If the door opens, we want a glance at the faces."

The steward walked the corridor with a red cylinder and a bored pace. The door opened from the inside with a quick peek, then closed. The glimpse showed shelves, a small bench, and a printer with two fonts taped to the side. A hand reached to adjust the tape, then moved out of frame.

They had enough to start the next move. They did not have enough to close it. That would come with the second packet and the first crate that failed the weight by more than talk could explain.

Draeven checked the time. "We keep the pressure light," he concluded. "Tonight we seed a second order from a different clinic with the same batch. We stagger the timing so he cannot mask both with one stunt. We place a pair of eyes near that housekeeping door and we do not blink."

He capped his marker and stepped back from the board. The day would keep its shape. The net would tighten by hours, not minutes. That was the only speed that held.

The second planted order rode the channels that evening. This time Colvern filed it from a different clinic with a different shipping lane. The batch number matched the first and the quantity was modest, but she shifted the wording just enough to look authentic. Elias signed the clinic end with steady hand. By nightfall the request lived inside the port's system like any other.

Hale and Joren watched the bonded lanes in rotation. They kept eyes on the scales, logging each pallet weight. Dax sat bent over the tracer console, his jaw set, one hand tapping a steady rhythm that marked the hours. Mira drifted between them with clinic updates, small notations about efficiency reports and patient outcomes. Draeven moved between posts like a foreman who knew better than to sit still. He checked each detail without fuss, made small corrections, and left others to their work.

The Custodian heard the first whisper of a second request from his own clerk. Two orders in one week, both for the same dead batch. That gave him pause. He paced his office with a pencil between his fingers. He tapped it once against the window glass and looked out over the port. Two mistakes in a month could be overlooked. Two in a week meant someone had caught the scent. He weighed whether to burn the line and cut the risk. Then he smiled thin and chose volume. Better to flood shelves with legal product, he reasoned, and drown their suspicion. If they wanted to trace a dead batch, let them chase smoke while real crates moved under proper invoices.

Down on the dock, the first pulse came just after midnight. The packet diverted through the reconciliation office again, took a short look, and moved back to the public lane. Thirty minutes later, the second order pinged from the records room. Same grey vest, same expired badge, same manila folder. The tracer lit Dax's screen with two red dots that now mapped a pattern rather than coincidence.

Joren marked the board. "That is a chain. Two orders, two desks, both siphoned to the same corridor."

"Which means," Hale added, "the Custodian has a fixed review path. He can watch demand before he decides what to pull."

Colvern underlined the corridor name. "We follow it to the crate lift. That is the mouth."

Elias called in with a fresh file. He had traced the nephew's shell company to a warehouse that once stored scrap dies from the shuttered plant. The company dissolved after eighteen months, but its charter had been renewed by another firm at the same address. A neat relay that kept the same name but shed liability with each step. He noted one director's signature across three shells. The name matched the man in the grey vest.

Draeven folded his arms. "So we have the plant, the die, the clerk, and the siphon corridor," he counted. "Not enough to close, but enough to prove design. Now we wait for him to move a crate heavy enough to cut his cover."

Hale checked her notes. "Scales flagged two pallets today at four kilos over manifest. If we can tie one to that corridor, it gives us the crate."

Mira laid down her pen. "Three clinics logged efficiency bumps from the same week. The demand pressure is rising. Buyers are talking. That will force him to move more of the counterfeit line."

The room stayed quiet for a long beat. Each of them knew the shape of the thing now. It was no longer rumor or theory. It was a system with parts and names. All it needed was time to catch its owner's hand.

In his office, the Custodian set his pencil down and smiled again. He told himself he had room to maneuver. He told himself the wardens were busy with water contracts and line disputes. He told himself that inspectors liked clean invoices more than clean floors. He believed his own story, the way men do when they have won too often.

But the tracer pings kept stacking, and the board in the wardens' map room filled with red dots that drew a path as straight as a chalk line. The siphon had a rhythm now, and once a rhythm shows, it can be cut.

Draeven closed the board with a line of his own. "We tighten the circle. We seed one more order tomorrow and place a steward at that corridor with a proper camera. No warning. No noise. If the Custodian takes another look, we take the picture that proves his hand. Then we start the squeeze."

They broke for rest. The ship hummed steady. Outside, the dock lights burned against the night. Somewhere in that web of desks and lifts and vouchers, the Custodian believed he still had the bow. The wardens knew better. They had the first notes of his song, and soon the rest of it would play.
