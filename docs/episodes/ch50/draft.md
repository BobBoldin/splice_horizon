Chapter 50 --- A Good Scarcity

He worked alone in the storage office that carried two doors and no windows. The light stayed even. The air ran cool. A ledger sat open on the desk with a grease pencil parked on the spine. The Custodian kept his hands still, then moved one finger to the next line and wrote a price that would hold for three days. Water turned profit when people counted cups. He preferred weeks, yet three days built heat, and heat moved goods.

Cold Mother had rolled the dice on that freighter hit for one reason: time. The Wardens chased thirst now. They packed shuttles and staked tarps on some salt world. They watched hoses instead of docks. That bought breathing room for the rack they lifted and every side job that liked a tight market. He respected her sense. He respected the bill that came with it. Lost thanatium had put a hole through her books. She would patch it with hard coin from ships that taste law in small sips. He would help her patch it because his cut carried weight and because the Wardens worked better far from his floors.

He closed his eyes and listened. The corridor carried a regular footfall from a worker who wore soft soles and a limp he would never admit to. Two decks down, a pump cycled longer than usual. The rhythm told him the seal bled pressure on each stroke. He smelled hot copper over the faint bleach that clung to this wing. The ship had changed flavor this week. People wore sweat longer. Soap stuck to skin. Mouths tasted dull. He tracked it because his work lived in those small shifts.

He did not need chatter from the couriers. He read them from twenty feet by breath alone. Fear smelled sharp, like a cut wire. Greed smelled warm, like oil on a worn tool. Lies pushed heartbeats up and shoved eyes just a hair off center. He measured those tells without effort. He had paid for a suite long ago that sharpened hearing and smell until edges looked carved. The paint on that job came out clean. The cost sat in places he kept private. Pain carried weight. He had learned to carry weight.

Water rationing paid. He wrote it in the book without apology. Token bundles for deck chiefs who wanted extra wash slots. Priority taps for cooks who could not keep a line fed on dry scrub alone. Quiet access to an unlogged hose in a machine shop that needed coolant makeup to meet a contract. None of it smelled like charity. All of it smelled like order: work gets supplies, and supply proves value. People called it black market when they ran short on grace. He called it smoothing rough edges so a ship did not grind itself to sparks.

He ran the math. One gallon per head per day for drink, prep, and a cloth over the face in the morning. Recovery used to live around ninety-six percent. The theft had dragged it down. Engineers would claw it back with cobble, yet every percent left on the floor turned into credits if he kept his hands steady. He set a schedule: morning bundles for galleys on clean scrip and a quiet uplift for the decks that paid into his pool last quarter. Couriers would carry rolls of chits that worked only in certain hours at certain taps. Fixed windows protected him from slop. A person who steals water outside the window draws eyes. A person who walks a chit to a valve during the window makes the day easy.

He thought about the lost media. The rack had no local buyers. Too hot. Anyone with sense would smell the chain. You do not sell a stolen badge at the front desk. But a smuggler out on the Routes, a captain with a quarter full of retirees and a taste for long life, a clinic on a back ring with a doctor who liked miracles more than ethics---that market stayed wide. Cold Mother would move the cases with the same clean steps she used last time she relocated a lab: mix the cargo with dull freight, accept a low price on two pieces to set a story, hold the last piece for the buyer who pays for privacy. He knew her playbook. He had written a chapter or two himself.

He lifted the pencil and mapped the next diversion. Water taught the ship fear and discipline. Fear and discipline kept Wardens on call and far from the places where his crews wrote invoices. The ship would calm again. When it did, he wanted a new noise that kept boots pointed away from his docks.

He let options walk through his head. A coolant scare in Refining would pull engineers into a spine of pipes where slip fittings could use attention. That lived as a half-truth he could feed with one loose clamp and a sensor that drifted hot for an hour. A contamination rumor in Hydroponics would run like fire if someone found a filament in the wrong trough. That game burned bridges he liked, so he set it aside. Counterfeit ration chips would piss off the quartermaster and pull Wardens into long interviews that bore no fruit and kept them off the decks for a shift or two. Too obvious. He preferred work that felt like fate.

Better: a labor squeeze around cargo cranes on C-ring. Crane two had a chain that wanted replacement. He could pay a stevedore to keep the maintenance request quiet and then push two rush jobs onto that pier with receipts and real names. The chain would skip under load, a crate would thump, and everyone would run down there to watch mechanics and foremen argue. Wardens loved arguments that smell like negligence. He could place three pickups on B-ring during that window and move goods to a quiet yard without a single uniform on the route.

His mouth curled. He tasted the day.

He flipped a page in the ledger and wrote a single word above the next line: cranes. Under that, he wrote two names, neither real. Carl would speak to the stevedore. Frank would walk the tool cage and keep a torque wrench from finding the right hands until the shift turned. A chain does not skip because of one man. It skips because ten people feel tired and one man guides the tide. He had learned that in rooms where men argued about blame while he built exits.

He pictured Linda in his mind and kept her out of this plan. The Wardens had touched her life and left a mark she would carry. She worked honest hours and put food on a table for a boy who needed someone to prove the world runs on steady hands. He felt no heat in his chest for her choice to talk when fear ate her spine. Fear does that. He paid her once. He would pay her again by steering clear. He preferred long games.

He checked the door, heard silence, and made a small call on a private line with a code that used air hiss as a seed. The man who answered worked a courier route on B-ring and knew how to keep voice flat. The Custodian spoke four sentences. The courier repeated the last words of each line and hung up. Money would move through three hands, none of them new. He liked that. New hands shook too much.

His head turned a hair. Someone had stopped two doors down. He heard a heartbeat step out of normal rhythm and a breath catch. He waited. The person leaned on the wall, then walked on. The smell he caught in that pause carried citrus and machine soap. Engineering. The footfall belonged to a woman who had hurt her knee last winter and now favored one side when she grew tired. She would sign a requisition later for gasket stock that Procurement had moved to another aisle. He could place a crate in her path and slow her one minute without touching her job. He filed the detail in that internal drawer where he keeps tricks for slow days.

He opened the next drawer. Wardens. He thought of Rane's voice at a distance: measured, warm, built to carry calm into hot rooms. She had earned better foes than the thugs he sometimes lobbed at her. He gave her better foes when she got too close: problems that read like fate and cost her time, not blood. That kept his house intact and kept her hands clean enough to sleep. He carried no hatred for her. He measured her like weather. Weather will drown you if you ignore the sky.

He drew a map in his mind of their current hunt. They built towers to polish water and stills to pull steam from waste heat. They seeded microbe beds and turned valves with tape and hope on them. They chased small leaks with tape and larger leaks with grief. They had strapped guns for a water world because planets do not care who gets thirsty. He needed them busy for nine days. Nine days gave Cold Mother a swing around a quiet rock and a sale to a buyer who had never met a ledger he could not sweeten.

Nine days. He counted them with a thumb against the desk. One, two, three. He paced the rest through tasks: crane delay, chip rumor in a small corner he could close when he felt like it, a false flare on a cargo monitor that flagged theft where a kid had only palmed an orange for his mother. Wardens would swarm, write three reports, and file them under "managed." He would slip two boxes through a hatch while they argued about policy.

He pulled a small case from the drawer and opened it. Two vials rested in a foam cutout. They were not the heavy cases Cold Mother had lifted. These held small runs he kept aside for buyers with taste. One carried a rejuvenation mix built on bland proteins with a drop of thanatium to silence the scaling that used to betray old work. The other carried a libido build that favored stamina and heat without imprinting on one partner the way some base meshes liked to do. People with money bought these like they bought art. They carried risk because every cut of thanatium writes a small end into a cell. That end drank profit. He smiled at the thought, then closed the case and slid it back. The buyers he used for these vials lived on other ships. This ship used money to stay alive, not to stay pretty.

He turned back to water. He rolled numbers in his head until they sounded right. Two hundred extra gallons per day from stills by day two. Three hundred on day three after they primed the second unit. Bio towers grow from trickle to legible flow on day four. Ration lines soften on day five. By day seven, the ship breathes easier. By day nine, men make jokes in lines again. Good. Jokes soften eyes. Soft eyes miss a quiet forklift and a crate that rides it.

He drafted a note for Cold Mother on a strip of paper. He kept paper for things that felt right in hand. "Ship holds," he wrote. "Wardens occupy. Water buys quiet. Nine-day window. Buyers ready on your side. Do not indulge in theatrics. We sell dull." He folded the strip, burned the corners with a small flame, and pressed it into a capsule for a courier route that crosses three hands and one laundry cart. He liked laundry carts. People look away from laundry.

He thought about The Wardens' young one, Joren. The boy had learned to stand again. He read strength in the new footfall and heard a change in the cadence that comes with legs that trust themselves. Hale had sharpened her reflexes to meet hands before minds finish plans. Dax had tuned his bones to carry guns meant for mounts. This unit grew teeth. He respected anyone who files their edges quiet and keeps discipline in the case. He planned to keep them busy and far. He would not break them unless they crossed the line that runs through his office.

He took one breath in through his nose and found the chemical note he wanted to remember. Solvent from the ration tag printer. Warm rubber from hose that had been cut and rejoined. Fresh metal from a still coil that had just met a wrench. Those smells flowed through the ship now. He planned to stay ahead of them. When those smells faded, he would plant new ones: coolant, citrus, ionizer sting. Each line wrote a story. Each story held a room for his hands.

The intercom clicked with a single tone. He glanced at the clock and lifted the receiver. A voice with a deckhand's rasp told him the crate with hooks would arrive near Crane Two at noon. He let a small approval ride his reply. "Place it and proof the load," he instructed. "Then eat and keep your shoulders down. Leave the keys in the lock where a foreman can find them fast. I want the repair to read textbook after the scene."

"Understood," the voice returned, steady.

He hung up and ran one more check through his sense memory. The corridor outside turned busy. Footsteps measured, then stacked. People carried papers again. Schedules move minds faster than fear. He could hear it already: ration lecture, work list, duty shift. Wardens would brief and fly. The water world would chew hours. Back here, cranes would skip, voices would rise, and he would sell silence to the men who need it most.

He pictured Cold Mother reading his note and washing it through her head. She ran a colder shop than his. She had thrown men away to keep a line clean. He could step into that cold when money and survival shook hands. He preferred warmth when he could afford it. He would prefer warmth until she sent him a message that smelled like debt. He felt that message in his near future and kept his jaw loose.

He lifted the ledger again and drew three boxes. One for water chits. One for crane hour. One for outbound freight on the slow tug that leaves before dawn with a manifest full of bolts and resin. He penciled a number under each box. He drew a line under the page and tapped the pencil twice. Good math.

He checked the hallway in person, then opened the inner door. Carl waited at the far end with his hands tucked into his sleeves and a mouth that kept words short. Frank leaned on a dolly with a crate strapped tight. Both men looked relaxed. Both men watched him for a cue the way dogs watch hands. He gave them one small nod.

"Crane hour," he told them. "Place the crate. Keep your eyes on your feet and your ears on the foreman. Let him own the scene when the chain slips. You walk away when a Warden turns, not when he walks in. The difference saves teeth."

Carl grinned without teeth. "We drift like deck dust," he replied.

Frank rolled the dolly once to feel the weight. "We meet the clock," he added.

They left without extra words. He listened to their footfalls fade. He closed the door and checked the latch. He seated the ledger in the drawer and closed it with two fingers on the corners, flat and quiet.

He looked at the wall where a plan lived in his head. Wardens to Megnar. Rations to quiet fear. Cranes to stir noise. Boxes to move when voices lift. Cold Mother to her sale. Buyers to their shame. He counted the nine days again, then lifted his hand and rubbed the scar at his ribs where an old build had taught him a lesson about greed and pain. Scar tissue writes memory better than ink.

He leaned back, breathed through his nose, and let a small line of humor live in his chest. Scarcity wrote his favorite kind of music: steady beat, low notes, a sharp fill when someone taps a drum with a ring on. He would play it until fresh media arrived and the ship forgot what thirst feels like. By then, other toys would have found their way into other hands, and the ledger would carry a new line with a number that made old men sleep well.

He rose, straightened his jacket, and picked up a stack of dull invoices. Dull paper kept sharp men alive. He left the office with a posture that fit a man who guards inventory and hates waste. He enjoyed roles that came with keys and boredom. Keys open most doors. Boredom moves people out of your way.

Work waited. The Wardens would work, too. He would watch their hands and their eyes when they returned. He would plan the next clock to keep them running. He carried no hate for them. He carried his shop and his accounts. Cold Mother carried the rest.

He walked the corridor and listened to heartbeats shift when he passed. He smelled citrus again. He thought about thanatium moving across a dock under dull tarps and men counting out money with clean nails. He smiled once with no teeth and kept going.
