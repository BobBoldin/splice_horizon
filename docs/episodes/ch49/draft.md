Chapter 49 --- Megnar in the Window

The planet Megnar filled the forward screens with hard color and rough weather. Bands of dust crossed a rusted basin, while pale brine flats flashed under a thin sun. Lightning walked across a storm shelf on the far limb, bright and brief. Scattered ridgelines ran like low breakwalls around the flats, and every ridge looked sharp enough to cut boots that wander. The planet held water in volume and trouble in equal measure, which fit the day's work.

Colvern stood by the chart and kept the room on task. "Orbit reads stable," she confirmed. "Weather tracks show windows at the north flats every six hours. We will stage two shuttles for the first lift, two for overwatch and medical. Wardens protect the draw sites, escort tank teams, and ride the last shuttle up."

Rane checked her slate and read the build like a foreman with steel coming off a truck. "Perimeter carries four points with overlapping view," she mapped. "Point One sits on the pump head, Point Two at the hose header, Point Three on the tank manifold, Point Four on the shuttle line. Hale runs Point One with close quarters kit and the new gloves. Dax covers Point Three with long tools and a clean line to the manifold valves. Joren runs Point Two with two deckhands to move hose and mark ground. Draeven and Halden split the line between Two and Four and float for gaps. I hold the map and move where the work needs a hand."

Patel stepped in with a valve list and an engineering calm that people trust when water sits on the far side of a hatch. "We will land two pump heads on skids," she briefed. "Each head feeds a four-inch hose up to a header saddle at Point Two. Hose drops to the manifold with cam locks and safety pins, then steps into twin tanks with clear gauges and bleed valves. We will seed a small biogaurd into each tank at half strength, then hand the stream to shipboard polishers on return. Muniz will crew the pumps and check for brine foam or grit. Expect flash squalls and windborne salt. We will bring tarps, stakes, and extra filters."

"Hook the tarps low and brace the stakes deep," Dax noted, eyes on the strobes of lightning. "Gusts will pull anything loose."

"They will," Patel agreed. "We will anchor with sand screws and cross-brace with cable."

Hale stood at the weapons bench with a pair of new gloves laid flat on a towel like instruments. She lifted one, slid her hand in, and flexed slow while the glove learned her first moves. Thin ribs along the back of the hand shifted under the skin like shutters finding their track. A soft chime from the wrist cuff confirmed sync. She closed her fist, opened it, and felt the micro-sensors meet the twitch before the muscle finished the thought. The gel layers under the knuckles stayed compliant through the flex, then firmed the instant she tapped the pad.

"These will keep bone honest," she measured, turning her wrist to check the bite along the thumb web. "Predictive stiffening loads the block early, gel catches the hit, and the glove releases without stealing dexterity. Good gear for close rooms and bad crowds."

"Put them through a dozen short drills before we drop," Rane advised. "Let the picture in your head match the glove's timing."

"I will run them on the bots and on the bag," Hale returned. "I will carry a spare pair in my kit."

Dax rolled his shoulder and lifted a lid on a long case that smelled faintly of oil and cordite. The Kestrel sat inside with its barrel cuffs and feed tray, heavy and patient. He checked the bolt face, set the spring, and set the shroud back with a click that always counted as a promise to him. A second case held a tripod gun he could lift and carry like a Breach-six on a long day, now that the new suite had settled in across the shoulder chain. He laid both on the bench, then pulled a compact launcher with blunt-tipped chemical rounds for crowd control at twenty yards.

"Point Three will need persuasion if a local crew pushes in," he assessed, steady. "Tripod covers the manifold and the tank heads. Kestrel waits in reserve for four-legged trouble from those ridges or a vehicle that does not read our beacons. I will place the tripod first and carry the Kestrel only when Patel signs off on the venting schedule."

Colvern marked it with a pencil. "Permission will follow the schedule," she confirmed. "We will keep the work clean and the headlines boring."

Joren checked harness points on a spool of four-inch hose with one eye on the usage limits stamped into the cam locks. The anchors in his shins and hips had become part of his posture, so the weight in his hands felt like a fair conversation rather than a dare. The month of work lay under every move he made: steady lift, honest foot placement, breath that lived in his ribs without drama. He turned the first cam, seated the pin with two fingers, and logged the mark.

"Point Two will live or die on simple habits," he offered, voice even. "Hose straight, saddle square, pins seated, seals clean. We place the first links right and the rest follows."

Hale gave him a quick glance and a small grin that carried both welcome and respect. "You will enjoy yelling at hose," she joked lightly, just enough to ease the air. "It listens better than people."

"It does when I line it up first," he returned, letting the grin answer hers, then he brought his eyes back to the hardware and moved through another checklist because humor tastes best when the work stays honest.

Halden walked the med kit for the ground teams, lifted each pouch, and named the contents like a quartermaster: two IV starts, ORS packets, pressure dressings, tourniquets, airway kit, and the cooldown spray for heat stress. "We will carry salt tabs in the breast pockets and drink on a count," she reminded. "Megnar runs dry air with gust fronts that pull sweat away before the brain recognizes the loss. We will fix that with timers and partners." She flexed her splinted arm once, watched the muscle jump under the brace, and nodded to herself that the line held. Then she caught Joren's eye and lifted two fingers: I am fine, and I watch the line.

Rane opened a case of beacons and passed them down the table. "Point markers, strobe or steady," she instructed. "We will set a ring around each site and paint a single path through the flats to the shuttle line. Tag one stake every twenty meters with reflective tape and an arrow. We will walk that path every lift and then again on the way back to sweep any stray eyes away from our gear."

"Locals?" Draeven asked, tone calm.

"Small groups around salt harvest and salvage," Rane answered. "Some crews use hard splices for long heat, some carry edge tools that will cut hose for barter. We will greet with clear hands and a sensible perimeter. We will never point a gun at a person who speaks first and steps back. We will move them away from pumps and keep them safe from our own moving parts. If they test the line to learn us, we will teach once with a buffer and twice with cuffs."

Colvern shifted to the shuttles. "Flight One lifts in four hours," she set. "Ship One carries Rane, Hale, Joren, Draeven, and two deckhands with the first pump head and half the hose. Ship Two follows with Dax, Halden, Muniz, and the manifold hardware. Ship Three stays high with Elias and two medics for evac or heat stroke. Ship Four holds in reserve with Patel and the second pump head, and drops when the perimeter reads stable."

Patel rolled her shoulders to settle stress that wanted to ride high. "We will prime the pump heads with tank water and keep the intake strainers clean," she continued. "Grit will chew seals faster than we can print them. We will float strainers on a small frame with buoyant collars, then bait them with fine mesh and a silver ribbon to keep bio growth honest."

"Bring spare strainers and mesh," Dax recommended. "Bring a pry bar for flat rocks if we seat near a ridge."

"On my list," Patel replied, tapping her sheet.

Hale wrapped her gloves in a dry cloth and slid them into a satchel with chalk and tape. She met Joren at the hose rack and walked him through grip steps one more time, patient and exact. "Hand on the collar, wrist straight, pin in at a flat," she coached. "Breathe before you pull, lift with legs, and place with care. These collars want straight love. Give it and they pay."

Joren matched her pace and absorbed the small tricks that turn strain into craft. He felt Kaela's picture of him the night before---legs strong, breath steady---sit inside his chest and warm his work without turning it into a song. He planned to bring that picture back in one piece.

Dax loaded boxes with a rhythm he liked: feed trays, belts, spare barrels, sand screws, cable, stakes, and a compact shield for the manifold crew. He checked weight and balance, then set the Kestrel case on the scale with a measured lift. The needle landed where his shoulder already knew it would land. He logged the number and closed the lid with a clean latch.

"Keep the Kestrel in Ship Two until the tanks anchor," Rane directed. "I want our first footprint small and agile. When the hose runs and the manifold holds, we add weight and teeth."

"Logged," Dax replied. "Tripod goes down first, muzzle covers sky and ridge lines, and nobody walks behind the line until we stake the arc."

"Correct," Rane affirmed. "We will paint that arc bright."

Colvern checked the time, then looked toward the viewing ports one last time. Megnar's brine flats reflected a thinner sun with a dull brightness that made the eyes work a little harder. Dust plumes moved across the northern basin like low banners dragged by a stubborn child. She wrote it down as wind out of the west at twenty knots with gusts higher, visibility fair between squalls, ground stable with crust and soft pockets.

"Briefing in thirty minutes," she announced. "Bring dry layers, sealed helmets, and extra eye protection. Tag your packs with weight and role. We will eat before we drop, because food in the gut carries more than pride in the throat."

Rane closed her slate and lifted it against her forearm like a habit. "Wardens," she called, voice warm and firm. "We land, we build, we draw, we leave, and we return until Meridian drinks on schedule. Keep your circle tight, your hands ready, and your humor dry. We will make this a story about work, not luck."

Hale rolled her shoulders once and let the gloves settle into her sense of timing. Dax stood his cases by the hatch and stretched his neck until the small line at the base of his skull eased. Joren squared the saddle rack for Point Two and gave the cam locks one more check. Draeven compared maps from orbital scans against ridge photos and circled three spots where an ambush would feel clever to a hungry crew. Halden counted drip sets and tucked ORS packets into the med kit where fingers could find them in a hurry. Patel and Muniz argued cheerfully about gasket stock and then agreed to pack double.

Through the glass, Megnar kept its weather honest and its water hard to reach. Meridian held orbit and waited with patience learned from long trips and tighter days. The ship had asked for discipline all week and had received it. The planet would ask for more by noon.

"Brief in the ready room," Colvern repeated, turning toward the door. "Bring everything you will need and nothing you will leave behind."

They filed out with quiet boots and steady breath. The plan ran clear in every mind, which is the only way plans survive first contact with wind, brine, and work that fights back. The first half of the job lived in lists and hands. The second would live where boots meet salt and a pump throws a clean stream into a tank that smells like promise.
