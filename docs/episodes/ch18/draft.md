Chapter 18 - Two Keys Turned

The briefing room sits three doors down from the medbay. Square layout, steel table, four chairs that have never been comfortable, and a wall unit that only turns on after a second press. The overheads are bright and even. The air runs a little cool and a little dry. Someone cleaned the tabletop too hard and left a pale streak that catches the light. A logistics officer waits near the door with a clipboard tucked under his arm. He watches the hall through the small window like he expects to be called out before this starts.

Elias comes in with a thin paper file. He prefers a real stack when a meeting is likely to turn. Paper reminds people that choices land somewhere you can hold. Colonel Rane is already seated on the far side of the table. Straight posture, steady eyes, hands flat on the surface like she has already drawn the box she wants to keep the talk inside.

He closes the door and sits opposite her. The chair legs give one short scrape. He sets the file in front of him, squares the edges with his thumb, and lifts the top page.

"Doctor," Rane says. "You sent notes. I asked for outcomes."

"You have the path to outcomes," Elias says. "Three candidate splices. Two are appropriate for the lab today. One needs routing we do not have yet."

"Give me the names of the splice candidates," she says.

"Velmari Skinmoss and Ferronox Shardlings today," he says. "Saphroot Mycelia stays in preparation until the room is built for it. I am not going to slap some tape on the floor and pretend that makes the room safe."

The logistics officer makes a small mark on his form. It might be a time note. It might be his way of staying out of it. He does not speak.

Rane keeps her attention on Elias. "You are about to bring up Article Twelve."

"I am," he says. "Volunteers only. Minimal necessary exposure. Clear abort lines. Consent read aloud in plain language. Subjects can stop at any time. We agreed to that before we left orbit."

"Article Twelve also calls out mission continuity," she says. "We have had three close calls in two weeks. A coolant valve froze shut. A maintenance bay lost lights during a manual reset. A lift stalled with two people inside. I am not going to let the ship keep running its own experiments on my watch."

"Then keep the work in the lab," Elias says. "Under lights. With a recovery cot within reach. If you want continuity, you want control. Field 'incidents' are not control. They are accidents with paperwork afterward."

She leans back an inch, not relaxed, just shifting to a different angle. "You like fences, Doctor. I need results now."

"You will get results," he says. "Measured and repeatable. Velmari first, short window under a mesh. Ferronox second, dry run on the coupler coil, then one minute if the numbers hold. No stacking. No pressure to perform. If we pace it this way we can build up instead of rebuilding after we break something."

Rane folds her hands. "Here is how we will proceed. You will run two trials in the lab this morning. One is the doctor's choice. One pushes the boundary. If you refuse, I can sit on my hands and wait for the next equipment failure. I would rather you keep this inside your glass walls."

Elias feels heat in his neck but keeps his tone even. "Spell out the constraints and I will write them into the header."

"No," she says. "*You* spell them out. ***You*** are the one who wants the fence to be visible."

He slides the top page across. The language is plain. "Volunteers only. No lottery. Baselines before exposure. Consent read out loud in this room and acknowledged on audio. For Velmari: one sixty-second window, fingertip guidance only, mesh on, board visible to the subject. For Ferronox: dry run on the coupler coil first. If the dry run holds steady, one minute under exposure. Two monitors on the board and one on the subject. Recovery within arm's reach. No second window today."

"Abort lines," she says.

He points to the list. "We stop if pulse rhythm drifts outside the normal band for more than five seconds. We stop if the subject reports chest tightness, head pressure, or visual haze. We stop if the board drops from green to yellow and stays there. There is no debate once that call is made. My call or Kaela's call ends the window."

Rane reads without picking up the page. She does not skip lines. "Selection."

"Bay Three deck technician for the Velmari window," he says. "Small hands, compliant, used to following procedure. Coolant maintenance lead for Ferronox. He is calm under load and knows this room. Both have done drills. Neither has a reason to grandstand."

Rane lifts her eyes from the page. "I am not here to test your ethics. I am here to move your schedule."

"You can press the schedule without pushing me into improvisation," Elias says. "Improvisation puts a subject on that cot with a story that sounds brave at dinner and a problem that shows up a week later."

Rane shifts her attention to the logistics officer. "You will not submit a request for a dozen meshes this afternoon. If the first one proves it can be cleaned, stored, and holds calibration after storage, you can request one more. One. If I see bulk orders, we will have another meeting, and you will not enjoy it."

The officer nods once and writes a clear line in his notes. He favors avoidance over argument.

Rane faces Elias again. "I am not going to arrange more field accidents to prove a point. If I think the lab cannot deliver, I will look for outcomes another way. None of us want that."

"You will get your data," he says. "You will get it without a rumor storm ripping the crew in half. Trials in the lab, windows and stops. If anyone tries to use an untested effect outside this room, that report will start with their name."

Rane places both palms on the table. "Two keys turned. Conservative first, then the boundary. You have the morning block. How long until you start?"

"Thirty minutes to finish baselines and set the board," he says. "Then we begin. If all goes well, we finish inside first watch."

Rane stands. Her chair does not scrape. "Keep the door shut to gossip," she says. "Post someone in the hall if you have to. If a curious face leans in, send them on and put my name on it. I will back you."

"That helps," he says. "Kaela can run point."

Her hand settles on the door control. She pauses. "Understand something, Doctor. I am not here to enjoy saying no. We have come close to a worst day twice this week. If these trials give me a tool I can put to work without it biting the hand that carries it, I will use it. If this turns into talk and trouble, I will shut it down."

"Then let me own the start," he says. "When we own the start, we control more of the ending."

She holds his look for one breath, then opens the door. She leaves without a closing remark. The logistics officer slides out after her, one hand on his clipboard like it might try to fall.

Elias waits a few seconds before he stands. The room feels bigger once it is empty. He places the page back on the stack, aligns the edges, and returns the file to his arm. The wall unit clicks off. He opens the door and steps into the corridor.

In the medbay he will add one line to the top of the file where no one can miss it: **Trials occur in the lab. Windows and stops. Field use without this step is an accident by another name.** He will lock the header, call Kaela, and set the room. First watch belongs to them if they take it. The lights are ready. The cot is close. The fence is up. Now the keys turn.
