Chapter 11 -- Year 1 Log

"Recording on," Elias said. "Meridian. Year One."

"We started this to fix Spiral: rebuild vessel anchors, stop the slipping. What actually happened: the Sunfan lattice works as a stabilizer, and it also carries over a few of its own quirks. Most patients just heal better. A smaller group shows extra effects."

He glanced at the wall: baseline tissue, Spiral tissue, and the Sunfan lattice overlay. "This was supposed to be a cure. Not a doorway to something else."

Mira came in with a tablet. "Update from Procurement. Wardens are now doing scheduled Sunfan harvests. Dried plate substrate ships out twice a week. Ground teams back home are using it as a standard stabilizer now."

"So we are an exporter," Elias said. "Great. Add that to the report."

"Mira set the tablet down. "Add a note on me. The ridge breach is already in the file. What's new is this: last month I dumped boiling water across my palm by accident. No blister. No pain. It just felt... warm."

Elias looked up. "Not adrenaline?"

"No. I waited for the burn. It never came." She met his eye. "Call it what it is: heat tolerance, at least in one staff member."

He nodded once. "We'll log it. And we're still not 'using' anything. Article Twelve holds."

The intercom clicked. "Captain Draeven here. Quick heads-up: pilots and handlers are logging odd moments after long harvest days. Nothing dramatic. Better heat comfort. A few 'saw the gauge sharper' comments. All short-lived."

"Okay," Elias said. "Shorter shifts. Mandatory cool-down. Write it down---every time. If anyone tries to play hero, send them home."

"Copy," Draeven said.

Mira watched him. "We can't keep calling this only restorative. We need a separate track: keep the main medical work as is, and add a monitor program for these carry-over effects. No recruiting. Just watch the people who already show something. Update consent, plain English."

"Do it," Elias said. "Advocate first, Tribunal after. And keep Article Twelve in bold: no field use. Not a little. Not 'just this once.'"

He faced the recorder. "Addendum: Wardens now harvest Sunfan substrate for export as an approved stabilizer against Spiral. Side effects noted in a minority: better heat tolerance, quicker soft-tissue recovery, occasional short visual changes. Actions: start a Hybrid Effects Monitor; update consent; tighten duty cycles."

He stopped, then added, "For the record: I signed up to repair anchors. I did not sign up to change people. But the carrier effect is real. We will manage it, not hide it, and we will not turn it into a weapon."

He killed the mic.

The ship's PA clicked on: "Deck One, line check. Cart traffic inbound."

Elias clipped on his badge and under his breath: "Not today."

The hangar smelled like hot metal and disinfectant. A crate of sealed Sunfan plates rolled past on a cart. Specialist Hale met Elias at the line.

"We've got a valve leak in P-bay. It is hot and cramped," she said. "If I crawl in, I can take the heat. I have handled worse lately.

Elias shook his head. "No. You wear full protection or you do not go in. Article Twelve. We do not 'use' anything you think you picked up from the work."

Hale kept her voice level. "We'll lose an hour waiting for the cool-down."

"Then we lose an hour," he said. "No exceptions."

Draeven stepped up, heard the last line, and nodded. "You heard the doctor," he told Hale. "Gear up or stand down."

Hale held his stare, then gave a quick nod. "Gear it is."

She walked for the locker room. Draeven watched her go. "You'll keep catching this, you know."

"I know," Elias said. "Keep logging it. The rule doesn't work unless we say it out loud every time."

Draeven cracked a tired smile. "Then we'll keep saying it."

They both looked at the cart of Sunfan plates. The labels were neat, the export seal clean. Useful medicine, boxed and ready. Elias hated that it also came with a second conversation he would be having for the rest of the year.

"Doctor," Draeven said, "you did not cause this."

"I opened the door," Elias said. "That is enough."

They moved on: one to a briefing, one to write consent language anyone could understand.

An hour later, in Conference Room Six, the recorder was off. They shut the door and the room went quiet.

Commander Aric Veynar sat at the head of the long table, hands flat on the wood. Across from him, Director Amaris Colvern's badge caught the low light. A third chair held a man in a plain gray jacket, Colonel Rane from tactical. Next to him sat Serano from the Advocate's office, eyes tired but steady. The air smelled like coffee and old paper.

Veynar did not bother with a greeting. "We've been pushing families into the Meridian under Continuance Rotation to hit volunteer quotas." He tapped the table. "That worked. We filled the slots and the program kept moving."

Colvern folded her hands. "We did not do it for charity. We did it to supply the sponsor with usable stabilizer. The Sunfan substrate is shipping out twice a week. It is on contract and it is working back home." Her tone was flat; this was business, not conversation.

Serano made a small sound. "Families understood the risk. Advocate oversight was present for every intake. The Tribunal's processes were followed, publicly and on paper." He nodded at Veynar, not as defense but as fact.

Colonel Rane leaned forward. "The problem is the window. The Meridian's work creates a resource we cannot ignore. The sponsor wants capability, tissue that takes strain and recovers faster. If we keep waiting for the Tribunal to change its mind, someone else will get ahead."

Veynar stared at the folder in front of him. "We promised the ship, the families, and the public a narrow program. Article Twelve is clear. No field deployment without an open override." He heard his own words and how they landed.

Colvern did not flinch. "Public votes are slow. The sponsor does not have time for slow. We cannot let the Meridian become the only place with this tech. We need to field a test that proves utility in real conditions outside Meridian control."

"Field splice," Serano said, the words flat and measured.

Rane's jaw set. "Not a test. A capability. Small teams. Off-book operations. We have a dozen stabilized recruits already out through rotation and regular hiring. There are people in maintenance, logistics, and security cover jobs. Several dozen if you include contracted workers who received mesh stabilization and were sent home as part of the export program. They are trained, they are loyal, and they are plausible as civilian contractors."

Veynar let that sink in. "You are proposing we take stabilized people and use them in operations that circumvent the Tribunal and the Meridian's oversight."

"Exactly," Rane said. "We find controlled, low-risk scenarios: hull breach responses, heat-containment runs, remote retrievals. We deploy teams that can rely on whatever edge the Sunfan integration provides. Success sells the program. Success buys us an acceptance later."

Colvern's eyes were hard. "We brief the sponsor quietly. We fund the logistics quietly. We keep paper trails minimal and use contractors where a formal chain would slow us down. The Meridian keeps its official line. You keep your conscience intact in public. We move in private."

Serano's hand hovered, then fell. "This is a legal and ethical minefield. If it leaks, if families find out their members were placed into operations under false pretenses, the fallout will be severe. The Advocate office will not stand for that."

Rane offered the operational fix. "We do not lie to families. We offer voluntary deployment with compensation under separate contracts. We recruit those who already have stabilization and explain the mission honestly, but not in a way that triggers immediate Tribunal review. We use layered contracts and private carriers. We do not advertise. We keep everything limited and incremental."

Veynar rubbed his thumb along the rim of his mug. He saw the logic: quick advantage, plausible deniability, the sponsor's deadlines. He also saw the risk: Tribunal headlines, families betrayed, the Meridian's public trust burned. He weighed it the way he had weighed other hard things in the past, by cost and likely outcome.

"Okay," he said finally. "We keep Article Twelve in the public record. We keep the Meridian's program narrow and transparent on paper. Privately, we run a pilot: three off-book teams, vetted contractors who already show Sunfan integration, strict rules of engagement, full medical monitoring, and compensation for families. Any adverse event, we pull the plug. No exceptions."

Colonel Rane's shoulders eased. Colvern slid a thin folder across the table. "Logistics routes, secure carriers, and a kick fund. You give me the go ahead and we start planning tonight."

Serano stood. "I will write the volunteer contracts and the advisories. I am putting clauses in that state the work is voluntary, that it is off-ship, and that it is under an emergency-use rubric. Families sign knowing the mission profile."

Veynar looked at each of them in turn. "We do not make heroes of the people we put at risk. We protect them, we pay them, and we manage fallout if it happens. If anyone on this table thinks they can hide consequences, do not pretend. We will own it."

Colvern's mouth tightened. "We plan for approval after results. We will not ask permission first."

Veynar closed the folder with a soft snap. "Then keep it tight. Three teams. No live combat. Recovery work and containment only. Medical on call. Full reporting to me. If anything looks like weaponization, we stop and publish everything to the Tribunal. No cover-ups."

Rane nodded. "Understood."

Serano hesitated at the door. "One more thing. If this leaks and families realize they were recruited for operations, they will ask who authorized it. Prepare a justification, policy brief, chain of command, sponsor directive. We will need a narrative for the Tribunal the minute this escapes. If it goes wrong, we do not want silence; we want a response."

Veynar stood. He felt the weight of the decision sitting in his chest like ballast. "Do it. Draft the brief. Keep the Advocate in a guarded loop. Start vetting contractors tonight. We move in the shadows but leave the path tidy if the light falls on it."

They left the room with work to plan and a secret that, once real, would be hard to tuck back away.
