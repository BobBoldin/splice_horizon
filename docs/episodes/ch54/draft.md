**Chapter 54: Routine Work**

The medical bay ran steady on a late shift, bright task lights over clean counters and folded linens. Filters kept the air even, a low band you could talk over without strain. He checked the coupler cradle and pulled a fresh cartridge from cold store. The label read Tremor Mitigation Suite, trace lithium adjunct, micro-dose pack.

Mira logged the prep with a neat hand. She wore the focused look she used when the work mattered and the room carried more than one purpose. Her shoulder brushed mine while she reached the tray. Warm. Present. Grounding.

"Vitals monitor is live," she reported. "Linda registers inside the safe window. Rest tremor at grade two, reach at grade three."

"Good." Elias lifted the cartridge toward the light and checked the seal. "We keep this simple and predictable. Routine lets the brain hold a line."

Footsteps came from the outer gallery. Two, then one, with a pause as someone used the corner mirror. Linda stepped in with her jacket zipped to the throat and her work bag close under one arm. Her right hand twitched on the strap, small, fast, regular. She blinked twice at the brightness and found us without trouble.

"Evening, Doc. Mira." Her tone carried the dry humor you hear on long shifts. "I brought the deluxe forearm for your inspection."

"We use the coupler port," Mira answered, dry and kind together. "There is no bruise risk with a clean seat."

"I will take that trade any day," Linda returned. "I keep sleeves rolled for heat in those tunnels, and I do not need the kids asking why my arm looks like a plum."

She eased onto the chair. Doctor Elias checked her forearm plate for wear, then ran a lint pad across the ring and keyed a quick diagnostic. Green across the strip. Seal showed square. I docked the cradle and heard the small click that always told me alignment was true.

"Same dose pattern," he told her. "We press in four cycles. You sip water between cycles. If you taste metal or feel a chill, you speak and we pause."

"Alright. I can do that," she replied, more conversational now. She set a paper cup where she could reach it and braced her wrist against the armrest. "If I start chattering, it will just be me trying to fill the quiet."

He latched the cartridge. The cradle motor spun, found position, and settled. A tiny status light held steady. Linda blinked once and breathed through the first pulse. The coupler port warmed under my fingers, a gentle heat through the plate. Her face eased at the edges while the dose moved.

Mira watched the monitor, then looked to me for the second pulse. "Timing boundary holds steady. Next cycle in thirty seconds."

He nodded and tapped the confirm. Slow. Even. Our hands matched without chatter. Procedures that run the same way every time will carry a person through a hard week.

Linda took a sip and watched the ceiling tile while the second cycle went through. "I came in for the routine," she began. "I brought a piece of information you will want to pass on."

"Go ahead and speak it," Elias prompted. "We have a quiet block."

"The Custodian smells a leak," she continued, voice low but steady. "He never used the word. He shifted me to low value runs. No fresh maps. No future notes. Only routes with shut-down orders dated for the next two weeks. He thinks I will not notice because I am busy and I am a mother with a list in my head. I notice."

Mira met Linda's eyes and lifted her hand from the tray. "You do the job right," she observed. "He moved you to scrap lines after you built his clean ones."

"I perform the assignments because the duty feeds people," Linda answered. "He can call it smoothing or trade. I bring water to hands that lost their place in line. Now my basket holds empty bottles, and I am meant to smile and thank him for the chance."

The third cycle queued. I checked the coupler ring for heat and looked for any patchy blanch around the seat. Fine. Even. "Any change in guard pattern, voucher color, or phrase use," he asked. "Small tells point at the list he reads."

"He dropped the blue chits," she reported. "All red now. He closed the extra window on the north quay and folded those people into standard hours. He told me to break down two reserve lockers. No replacement order followed. I can discern when someone plans to lock a door."

That matched the picture from our last brief. He expected tighter eyes and fewer corners in the next month. He would pull value early and keep his personal risk low. He pulled Linda off anything that could trip him. He trimmed her world and looked for a tell.

Mira checked finger flexion. The tremor already dropped a grade. "Any cold bite or tingling," she asked. "Any metal taste?"

"None," Linda answered. "Jaw loosening. Shoulder easing. I can hold a pen without drawing a snake, and I have three forms to sign before breakfast."

"Good." He pressed the third cycle and watched her pulse line. Strong and regular. "We keep within the usage limit and hold your safe line. You breathe through the next two minutes. Then we run the checklist."

Linda let out a small dry laugh. "You two make it sound like a brake job. Pull and proof. Grease and torque. Back on the road by lunch. I like that, because I can measure that and I can plan dinner around it."

"Do it right the first time," Mira returned, mouth ticking. "Fewer returns."

A soft chime marked the next interval. He confirmed the fourth cycle and watched the counter fall to zero. The coupler released with a clean click and a soft hiss as the seals relaxed. The plate cooled across twenty seconds, a smooth fade under my gloved fingertips.

"He pushed you to routine because he sees risk," the doctor offered. "You hold your head. He cannot steer that without noise. He trims and watches."

"He will test any new friend," she replied. "Shoes, bag, nails. He will ask the binder clerk if I stood near the copy shelf. He will measure washroom time. He thinks in ledgers, and I know that rhythm."

"We can use that," Mira returned. "We keep your pattern neat. We remove flex that looks like a fresh tie. You bring us small, stable pieces through casual paths. Your clinic visits sit on schedule and read as standard care."

Linda considered that, then nodded once. "Neat works for me. I keep a family calendar with three colors and a column for leftovers. This is the same muscle."

I undocked the cradle and wiped the ring. "You will feel a soft heaviness in the forearm for ten minutes," he told her. "It clears by the second gallery. Drink water at each ladder and keep your shoulders loose."

She rolled her wrist and touched thumb to pinky with a small smile. "That feels right," she answered. "I have fine-motor work in the morning. I would like not to fling bolts across a floor."

Elias cleaned the tray and dropped the spent cartridge in the bin. A service cart rattled over the grate in the forward hall. Boots followed at a regular pace, then faded past the turn. The room kept to machine noise and steady breath while we set the next steps.

"We adjust your clinic route for two weeks. You come through supply on the early hour and use the service lift. Wear a soft brace on the shoulder for cover. The front desk will record physical therapy. The Custodian will read a clear line in the book."

Mira pulled a small box from the cabinet. "Cooldown kit for home use," she told Linda. "Ice pack, strap, and hand drills. Ten minutes on each set, twice a day. Log it on this card and bring it next visit so our record matches your story."

Linda slipped the kit in her bag. "He will send me on a junk errand tomorrow," she predicted. "Some dock that moved last month. He will wait to see if I come back flustered."

"You bring back a clean account. Mark the closure sign, pick a clerk name, and stick a scrap of tape to your cuff. Show work around a dead window. He will see a worker who fills gaps and will relax by two ticks."

Mira lifted the tablet. "Your next booster sits at six days," she added. "We hold the interval tight until sleep improves. Bring a list of hand tasks that still feel rough. We adjust at the margin."

Linda checked the coupler ring and zipped her sleeve. Her shoulders lined up square again. Calm returned to her posture in a way I trust more than any number. She stood and looked at both of us with that direct shipyard gaze that cuts through half-truths.

"You two do clean work," she offered. "I will bring more when I can. Keep those pumps steady on Megnar. The clinics keep a noon line because of you, and that matters to people with kids who nap after lunch."

"We logged those terms in daylight and on the record," Mira replied. "They hold because people can see them. The noon barrels will arrive."

Linda grinned, a line of warmth in a week with hard edges. "You talk like a person who counted parts for her father," she teased. "I like that kind of order. It lets me breathe."

"I did," Mira answered. "He kept bolt bins with chalk marks and three colors of tape. I learned to trust a shelf you can see clearly."

Elias walked Linda to the door and watched for any shift in her gait. Stable. Forearm heavy, as expected, yet fingers precise on the bag strap. She paused once to stretch the shoulder, then looked back.

"One more piece," she offered. "He added a route validator last month. Not a sense suite. A wrist band that pings dock beacons and logs stop times. He checks voucher hashes on the spot. If time or place drifts by a hair, it flips red. He keeps the band under his sleeve. The charge port was observed to be at the cuff when he leaned over the counter."

"That helps. We place you on paths with clean beacons and steady clocks. You carry receipts with proper hashes and a clerk name. Use the service lift with our cover ticket so his log aligns. Keep your stops short and inside posted windows. His band will register a neat pattern and move on."

"Alright," she replied with a small nod. "I can fold that into my loop. If I forget, my son will remind me. He notices things like that."

They watched her move through the gallery and turn out of sight. He closed the chart and slid it into the drawer with the lock plate. Mira washed her hands and dried them with slow care.

"She carries fear with a steady back," He offered.

"She carries pride the same way," Mira answered. "That pride holds her shape when pressure climbs."

He let the truth of that sit. Work like this asks for more than a kit and a form. It asks for a way to hold a person upright while you move pieces they do not see.

"Next," he told Mira. "We brief Colvern on the sense suite and the dead routes. We pass a note to Rane about the service-lift cover and clinic timing. We mark Linda's kit as issued with a spare card so the front desk keeps the story clean."

Mira logged the lines. "We also set a small test," she added. "We place a harmless piece inside one shut-down route and watch who tries to lift it. If the Custodian sends a feeler, we learn his reach."

"Good," he replied. "Build it. Keep it neat."

Mira set the tablet down with a small nod. "Neat is our flair."

He checked drawers and seals, then looked over the room. Work to do. Clear steps. People to keep upright.

"Let us keep it clean," He told her. "We do the next piece right, and the piece after that."
