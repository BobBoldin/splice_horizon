Chapter 24 -- The Holdout

They took the corridor in two lines with thermals up, moving at the pace that lets a mind keep up with a body. The runner had left warm handprints along the right wall and a smear on the door frame at the far end, which meant they were not thinking about concealment so much as speed. Hale marked the smears and kept her muzzle level. Joren held rear left and counted intersections. Dax watched the ceiling cuts for a drop-in. Halden kept her eyes on the floor plates that never seemed to sit quite flat in this part of the galleries.

The door at the end of the lane opened on a short service cross. The panel to the left showed a weak green from a battery that did not belong to this station. The runner's heat trail broke across the cross and turned right toward a low hum that sounded like a fan struggling with dust. Hale ran the cone across the right-hand tunnel and saw three faint shapes at different heights, then one brighter shape farther back moving fast and narrow. The fast one matched their runner.

"Right," Hale said. "Three near. One moving away."

"Capture if possible," Rane said. "Do not lose the runner if you can help it."

They entered clean. Two racks on the left gave small cover. The floor grated underfoot. The air smelled like burned insulation with a bite of cold air coming from somewhere deeper. The first near heat signature resolved into a figure crouched behind a crate with a piece of pipe held like a baton. Hale held a hand up, palm out, and approached at an angle that kept Dax's field clear. The figure did not swing. It watched her hands, then lifted its pipe a little higher as if it wanted to look bigger than it was.

"Hands where I can see them," Hale said.

A voice came from deeper in the tunnel, steady enough to carry but not loud. "We do not want a firefight." The speaker stepped out from a shadowed doorway with both hands lifted and open, palms forward to show empty. The face looked like any colonist you might pass in a dock canteen: young, tired, jaw set like they were done being talked down to. The arms and neck told a different story. Scars ran in clean lines that did not match injury, and thickened bands crossed under the skin like someone had stitched strength into the wrong places.

"We splice to cut Meridian's chains," the speaker said. "No one asked us when you came. You took what you needed and called it duty. We take what we need and call it living."

Rane moved up to Hale's shoulder. Her voice stayed even. "Put the pipe down. Step forward. You will not be harmed."

The crouched figure looked at the speaker, then set the pipe on the crate and showed empty hands. A third person eased up from behind a cabinet with eyes that did not settle on any one of them, a kid not much older than Joren with dermal plates that made the cheekbones sit wrong. The runner's heat signature flickered at the far turn, then steadied. They were still there, listening or waiting.

"We want the one who ran," Hale said. "The rest of you will be cuffed and taken in. You will see a medic. If you cooperate, you walk again when the court has done its work."

The speaker shook their head once. "Courts serve Meridian. We serve ourselves." The jaw tightened as if they were getting ready to spit a longer speech and thought better of it. "Take us if you want. You will hunt one of us at a time and call that order."

Draeven came up with Halden on his right. He looked at the doorway where the runner had disappeared, then at the three in front of them. He made the call with no heat in it. "We capture this group. We keep a line on the runner. Hale, Dax, take the talker and the crouched one. Halden, Joren, bring the third forward and restrain. Rane and I will hold the turn."

They moved as assigned. Hale set a path that kept angles honest. Dax holstered the canister and left his hand near it in case the talker tried to bolt. The crouched figure stood slow with hands raised and eyes on Hale's chest rig like they understood exactly where the threat lived. The kid by the cabinet watched Joren approach and flinched when he saw the cuffs.

"Hands behind you," Joren said. "Wrists together."

The kid's voice shook. "I am not an enemy."

Joren hesitated. The hands he was about to tie belonged to someone his own age with skin that showed bad decisions carved into it by people who said they were helping. He saw the plates under the skin and the thinness above the eyes and thought about how a face changes when a body is fed and left in peace. He knew he had a job. His hands did not quite move.

Hale saw the hitch and shifted her weight. She kept her eyes on the talker and said a quiet line that only Joren would hear. "You can be gentle and still be firm."

Joren nodded and stepped in. He turned the kid's wrists without twisting and set the zip cleanly. The kid pulled once against the tie and then looked at the floor. Joren checked finger color and capillary response because that is what capture means when it is done right. "You will be able to feel your hands in a minute," he said. "We are not here to hurt you."

The talker kept their hands up while Dax approached. Up close he could see the seams where someone had laid thickening agents along tendon lines. The work was crude but focused. Someone had a plan and a small kit. He set the first cuff. The talker did not fight it, but their eyes never stopped measuring.

"You walk us out and you take him," the talker said, tipping their chin toward the far turn. "He will not go easy."

"Not our first day," Dax said.

A shape moved at the turn. Rane's hand lifted and stilled the line. The runner leaned into view with a tool in one hand and a strip in the other. They had a face mask and a short hood and a body that ran hot down the forearms and calves. The tool looked like a cutting head from a boring rig cut down and wired wrong. The strip might have been a trigger or a decoy. The runner studied them like they were choosing between bad options.

"We are leaving," the runner said. "You can stay and lecture if that helps you sleep."

Draeven did not raise his voice. "You know what happens if you try to cut through us."

The runner smiled a thin line. "You break a few ribs and write a tidy report."

Rane kept her muzzle steady and her tone flat. "We capture and we treat. You can hate us while you heal."

The runner stepped back a pace and the talker exhaled, nerves showing for the first time. "He does not make good choices," the talker said, low. "He will run you into a charge and call that freedom."

Draeven's eyes did not leave the corner. "We do this clean. No stray rounds. Less lethal first if we can earn it." He glanced at Joren just once. "Stay with your task."

Hale started the move that would close the door on the runner's lane, slow at first to avoid spooking the group in cuffs. The kid flinched and took a step she did not like. Her hand tightened on his tether. "Easy," she said. "Eyes on me."

Joren felt the tether draw in his hands. His grip was steady now, but his chest still felt tight. He had a thought he did not say out loud: if they had met in a cafeteria with another year on their faces and no plates under their skin, they might have argued about music or route shortcuts. He closed the door on that thought because it would not help this room.

The runner moved first. He cut right and tried to slide along a narrow drain where the floor dropped half an inch. Dax swung the net canister and fired across the angle. The grid opened well but caught the rack edge and folded, losing spread. It still clipped the runner at the hip and threw him off balance. He stumbled into the wall, hit hard, and then bolted straight instead of cutting back. That told Hale enough. He was running scared, not running smart.

"Second net," Dax said. "Angle is bad."

"Hold," Rane said. "We have civilians cuffed."

The talker looked from the runner to Hale. "You cannot catch him and keep your hands clean."

"Watch us," Hale said.

Joren started to move before the order and checked himself when he saw Draeven's hand flatten. The warning was quiet and exact. "Mercy is not hesitation," Draeven said. "It is discipline."

Joren let the words sit. He felt the shape of them more than the sound. He eased the kid a step back against the cabinet where cover was real and then looked to Rane for the next call.

Rane adjusted the stack. "Hale, you are point on the runner. Dax, left lane to cut. Halden, hold the cuffs and call movement. Joren, rear security. If we lose sight, we stop and reset. No blind chase."

They moved. The runner had ten paces on them and another five in the turn. Hale drove to the corner and cut the angle tight enough to keep him in her thermal cone. Dax took the parallel lane and spotted a hand smear at chest height where the runner had braced, which meant a change in elevation ahead. He signaled ladder with two fingers. Hale nodded and slowed a half step for the transition because speed without footing is just a fall that takes longer.

They hit the ladder ring and found a short drop to a lower gallery crowded with carts and hose reels. The runner's heat trace crossed the first aisle and jumped a low crate with a clean set that said practice. Hale did not jump the crate. She slid along the left, kept balance, and looked for the tell that says a charge sits where a foot should go. She saw it in the way dust clumped under one corner. She did not test it. She marked it and passed.

Voices rose to their left: two, maybe three. The runner's friends, or another holdout cell. Dax took the left edge and flashed one lamp high for a second to catch shapes without giving them a steady target. Three figures. One with a long tool. One with a short pipe. One empty-handed, hands up, mouth moving in a fast line that sounded like a plea.

"Talker," Dax said. "Hands up, front."

Hale cut right to keep the runner boxed. He hit a low hatch and shoved through with his shoulder. The hatch scraped hard. The sound gave them the moment they needed to close. Dax covered the trio without firing. Halden brought the cuffed group forward in a slow, careful path that kept them out of the lane.

Hale put her hand on the hatch and felt the vibration of feet on the other side. Not many. One or two. She made the call. "We take the room. Less lethal first. Capture if possible."

Rane came up on her shoulder. "Set it and go."

Hale breathed once, then twice. She felt the sweat dry on her neck where the helmet seal sat and told herself that meant she had time to think. She lifted the latch, rolled her shoulder to clear the frame, and stepped through into the holdout's pocket with her muzzle low and her balance high, ready to stop a young man who did not know what he was about to make of his life.
