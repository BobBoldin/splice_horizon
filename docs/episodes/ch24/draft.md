Chapter 24 -- The Holdout

They took the corridor in two lines with thermals up, moving at the pace that lets a mind keep up with a body. The runner had left warm handprints along the right wall and a smear on the door frame at the far end, which meant they were not thinking about concealment so much as speed. Hale marked the smears and kept her muzzle level. Joren held rear left and counted intersections. Dax watched the ceiling cuts for a drop-in. Halden kept her eyes on the floor plates that never seemed to sit quite flat in this part of the galleries.

The door at the end of the lane opened into a short service cross. A panel on the left showed a weak green from a battery that did not belong to this station. The runner's heat trail cut across and bent right toward a low hum like a dust-choked fan. Hale swept the right-hand tunnel with the cone: three faint shapes at different heights, and one brighter shape farther back, narrow and fast. The fast one matched their runner.

"Right. Three near. One moving away."

Rane over comms: "Capture if possible. Do not lose the runner if you can help it."

They entered clean. Two racks on the left gave small cover. The floor grated underfoot. The air carried burned insulation with a bite of cold from deeper in. The first near signature resolved into a figure crouched behind a crate with a pipe held like a baton. Hale raised a palm and approached on an angle that kept Dax's field clear. The figure held still, watched her hands, then lifted the pipe a little higher to look bigger than it was.

"Hands where I can see them."

A voice came from deeper in the tunnel, steady enough to carry. "We do not want a firefight." The speaker stepped out of a shadowed doorway with both hands open, palms forward. The face could have been any dock canteen colonist: young, tired, jaw set like they were done being talked down to. Arms and neck told a different story. Lines of scar did not match injury, and thickened bands crossed under the skin like strength had been stitched into the wrong places.

"We splice to cut Meridian's chains. No one asked us when you came. You took what you needed and called it duty. We take what we need and call it living."

Draeven slid up to Hale's shoulder, muzzle set, voice even. "Pipe down. Step forward. You will not be harmed."

The crouched figure checked the speaker, then set the pipe on the crate and showed empty hands. A third person eased up from behind a cabinet---about Joren's age, eyes that would not settle, dermal plates pulling the cheekbones off true. The runner's heat flickered at the far turn, then steadied: still there, listening or waiting.

"We want the one who ran," Hale said. "The rest of you will be cuffed and taken in. You will see a medic. Cooperate and you walk again when the court has finished its work."

The speaker's jaw tightened. "Courts serve Meridian. We serve ourselves." A longer speech almost formed, then died. "Take us if you want. You will hunt one of us at a time and call that order."

Draeven glanced to the turn where the runner had vanished, then back to the three in front. "We capture this group and keep a line on the runner. Hale, Dax: the talker and the one at the crate. Halden, Joren: bring the third forward and restrain. Rane and I hold the turn."

They moved as ordered. Hale kept angles honest. Dax left his hand near the canister in case the talker broke. The crouched figure stood slow with hands high and eyes fixed on Hale's chest rig, reading where the threat lived. The kid by the cabinet watched Joren approach and flinched at the cuffs.

"Hands behind you. Wrists together."

"I am not an enemy." The kid's voice shook.

Joren paused. The wrists in front of him belonged to someone his own age, skin marked by bad choices carved in under the name of help. Plates under the dermis. Thinness above the eyes. He thought about how a face changes when a body is fed and left in peace. He still had a job. His hands hesitated.

Hale caught the hitch and shifted her weight, eyes never leaving the talker. A quiet line for Joren alone: "Be gentle and be firm."

Joren nodded and stepped in. He turned the wrists without twisting and set the zip clean. The kid pulled once against the tie, then looked down. Joren checked finger color and capillary refill because that is what a clean capture requires. "Sensation will come back in a minute. We are not here to hurt you."

The talker kept hands up while Dax closed. Up close he saw seams where someone had laid thickening agents along tendon lines. Crude work, focused aim: a plan and a small kit. First cuff on. The talker did not fight, but the eyes kept measuring.

"You walk us out and you take him." A chin tip toward the far turn. "He will not go easy."

"Not our first day." Dax clicked the second cuff.

Movement at the turn. Draeven's hand lifted and stilled the line. The runner leaned into view with a tool in one hand and a strip in the other. Mask, short hood, heat bright down the forearms and calves. The tool looked like a boring-head cutter cut down and wired wrong. The strip could be trigger or decoy. The runner studied them like choosing between bad options.

"We are leaving. You can stay and lecture if that helps you sleep."

Draeven kept his voice even. "You know what happens if you try to cut through us."

A thin smile. "You break a few ribs and write a tidy report."

Hale shifted to square on the lane, muzzle low. "We capture and we treat. Hate us while you heal if you need to."

The runner eased back a pace. The talker let out a breath, nerves finally showing. Low to Dax: "He does not make good choices. He will run you into a charge and call that freedom."

Draeven did not take eyes off the corner. "We do this clean. No stray rounds. Less lethal first if we earn it." A glance to Joren. "Stay with your task."

Hale started to close the runner's lane, slow enough not to spook the cuffed group. The kid twitched and took a step she did not like. Her grip tightened on the tether. "Easy. Eyes on me."

Joren felt the tether draw. Grip steady now, chest still tight. A thought came and he shut it down: a cafeteria, another year on their faces, no plates under their skin, an argument about music instead of this. Not helpful now.

The runner moved first: cut right, slid along a narrow drain where the deck dropped half an inch. Dax swung the canister and fired across the angle. The grid opened well, clipped a rack edge, folded, and lost spread. It still caught a hip and threw the runner off balance. A hard hit into the wall, then a bolt straight instead of a cutback. Running scared, not smart.

"Second net. Angle is bad." Dax shifted a foot to clear his lane.

Rane over comms: "Hold. Civilians cuffed."

The talker looked from the runner to Hale. "You cannot catch him and keep your hands clean."

"Watch us." Hale kept posture square.

Joren started to move, checked himself when Draeven's palm flattened. "Mercy is not hesitation. It is discipline."

The words settled in him. He edged the kid back against the cabinet where cover was real, then lifted his chin to Rane's channel for the next call.

Draeven maneuvered them. "Hale point on the runner. Dax left lane to cut. Halden hold cuffs and call movement. Joren rear security. If we lose sight, we stop and reset. No blind chase."

They moved. The runner had ten paces and another five in the turn. Hale drove to the corner and cut tight to keep him in her thermal cone. Dax took the parallel lane, spotted a palm smear at chest height where the runner had braced: elevation change ahead. Two fingers signaled ladder. Hale nodded and bled a half step for the transition. Speed without footing is a longer fall.

They hit the ladder ring: short drop to a lower gallery crowded with carts and hose reels. The heat trace crossed the first aisle and cleared a low crate with a clean set that said practice. Hale did not jump. She slid left, kept balance, and checked for the tell that marks a charge where a foot should go. Dust clumped under one corner, a hair darker in a tight square. She did not test it. Marked and passed.

Voices to the left: two, maybe three. Friends, or another holdout cell. Dax took the edge and tapped one lamp high for a single count. Three figures froze in the flare: one with a long tool, one with a short pipe, one empty-handed, palms up, mouth running a fast plea that broke on the second word. Dax dropped the beam and held them on angle with posture alone.

"Talker front. Hands up."

Halden walked the cuffed pair on a careful path, hips square, eyes working the upper racks for movement. "Two secured, moving. No heat above head height."

Hale cut right to keep the box tight on the runner. He hit a low hatch and shoved through with his shoulder. The scrape gave them what they needed: sound and a line. Joren counted to two and set rear security on the aisle, muzzle low, breath even through the mask.

Hale set a palm to the hatch. Vibration through the skin: feet on the other side. One, maybe two. A fast, nervous tap that did not match training cadence. She met Dax's eyes, then Halden's. "We take the room. Less lethal first. Capture if possible."

Draeven stepped to her shoulder and checked the edges: hinges left, handle right, frame bowed slightly inward from the shove. "Set it and go."

Hale breathed once, then twice. Sweat drying at the helmet seal told her she still had time to think. She pulled the latch and rolled her shoulder to clear the frame. A shallow pocket opened beyond the hatch: six meters wide, eight deep, low ceiling with a cable tray sagging near the back. Two bodies inside. The runner at the far wall with the cut-down tool held chest-high. Another young man closer in, eyes wide, empty hands up, feet rooted like he had not decided whether to move.

Hale entered on a slow half step, muzzle low, balance high. Dax flowed to her left, less-lethal up: S-Pulse at ready, thumb indexed on the press. Joren held the doorway and set a clean line back to Halden's position. Rane's channel stayed clear.

"Tool on the deck," Hale said. "Two steps back. This ends with you walking."

The runner's gaze flicked to the second boy, then to the cable tray, then back to Hale's hands. The strip in his off-hand twitched like a promise he did not fully understand. He braced one heel, tried to angle for the tray.

Dax's voice did not rise. "Do not do it. Short press or full ride. Your call."

A moment passes. The boy near the middle swallowed and dropped to his knees. Palms stayed high. "He is just scared," he whispered. "He is not as brave as he is acting. He is just plain scared."

Hale shifted three inches to put herself between the cutter and the kneeling boy. "Then he can be scared and smart. Tool down. Two steps back."

The cutter's shoulders dipped. The strip wavered. He set a heel again like a sprinter on a bad start. Dax opened his stance a hair and settled the S-Pulse at the runner's shoulder line.

"Last chance," Hale said. "Walk out. Heal up. Hate me later."
