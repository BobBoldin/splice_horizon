Chapter 47 --- Paid in Steel

The freighter ran a quiet route with a small crew and a clean log. Four hands on rotation kept the watch: a captain who liked his coffee thick, a pilot who trusted autopilots within reason, a mechanic who packed his tools in foam, and a clerk who treated manifests like honest scripture. The ship carried ordinance, protein blocks, repair kits, and a sealed rack bound for Meridian with a priority code that kept traffic control curious and polite. The hull carried patch plates from old work, the good kind that seat flush and do not chatter.

They took cargo at Red Gate and lifted on schedule. Twelve hours out, a small coil-cutter peeled off a tug lane and fell behind their wake with thrusters masked by engine noise. The cutter held four. They wore clean mag boots and carried line guns with quiet jacks. None of them leaned on luck. Cold Mother had no patience for men who gamble their tools.

The fifth hand had already boarded.

He rode in as a crate of freeze-dried greens, shrink-wrapped and labeled to match the manifest. The crate held a false floor and a man folded down to a shape that looked like a child's toy to anyone without experience. His body had been rebuilt on purpose: long bones dissolved and replaced by a flexible lattice that could collapse and then climb back into a scaffold under pressure. He had trained the pain down into a place he could lock behind a healthy tolerance. He called himself Sleeve because the name fit the function.

When lights dimmed for the night cycle, Sleeve counted to one hundred and eased the false floor with two fingers hooked into a lip he had filed into the plastic two days earlier. He slid out, lay flat, and waited with his cheek on cold metal until the patrol passed. He crawled under the pallet with shoulders that could flatten to the thickness of a hand, then worked into the service corridor through a cut in the kick plate that a lazy inspector would miss. He kept his breath slow because air carries stories. He listened to the engine room and felt its rhythm through the deck with a palm. The ship ran steady.

The main shield bus sat behind a panel with a star washer that the mechanic had not rotated in two months. Sleeve placed a bit into the screw and eased it without rattle. He stripped the panel with care, slid his hand inside, and counted connectors by touch. Three heavy feeds, one logic lead on a ribbon, and a small jumper that marked the bypass a factory tech keeps for emergencies. He clipped the logic lead with a pair of ceramic shears and bridged the bypass through a pocket board with a switch the size of a thumbnail. Shields dropped from full to standby with a soft click the bridge would hear as a routine jog. He didn't leave it that way for long. He waited for the engineer to run the check, hear nothing wrong, and drink again.

He moved to the engine room bulkhead with care. His bones flexed like rubber through the squeeze, then firmed when he widened again to reach the latch. He slipped a wedge into the interlock and spun it half a turn. The interlock woke and read safe because his wedge made the sensor honest when it should have screamed. He knew the model and the habit of the mechanic who owned it. He reached into the backup panel, pulled two fuses, and tucked them into his sleeve. The main drive kept turning. The APU died. The lights held steady on the big bus, yet the defense grid read a harmless heartbeat.

He crafted a short pulse on the shipnet with a tone lifted from the captain's voice, which he could mimic well enough for short lines. "Grid maintenance," the clip announced on a loop. "No action needed." He did not overplay it. Cold Mother liked clean work and short lies.

The cutter drew close on a vector that looked like drift to an untrained eye and like work to anyone who has ever run lines in a storm. The pilot, a woman who used to fly trams without rails or fear, counted off angles while she chewed a stick and kept her shoulders down. She wore a hard splice that gave her inner ear a second set of tools. The man in the forward locker, a heavy loader called Pike, watched for movement and flexed his fingers in slow rhythm to keep them warm. His suite pooled extra blood in the grip muscles and let his wrists shrug off torque that ruins normal men. Rook, the quiet one with eyes that paid attention to light the way an electrician listens to a wall, rode comms and frequencies. He read the freighter's chatter and tapped at a dial with small moves that looked like nervous habits and worked like a map. Lace, tall and quick, rolled her shoulders with the tight motion of someone who knows where every joint sits in space. Thin bundles ran under her skin from forearm to wrist like braided cable, and her hands carried strength that showed only when work demanded it.

"Boarding window in thirty seconds," the pilot informed, tone even. "Shields sit polite. Sleeve played his part."

"Hook on the second mark," Rook followed, eyes on the ripple of their own signature and the small lift in the freighter's station-keeping tone that told him where the ship thought empty space felt heavier.

Pike braced at the hatch. Lace clipped the line hook to the outer rim and checked the teeth. The pilot feathered thrusters and brought the cutter nose to the cargo lip with the patience of someone who respects paint and lives to keep it on. The hook shot with a thunk and bit. The line pulled tight, and the cutter stuck to the freighter with a grip a welder would admire. The hatch opened on clean seals that someone checks on schedule. They moved with quiet purpose and stepped across into a ship that had grown used to honest nights.

Sleeve met them in the dark of the service corridor on the far side of the engine room. He had locked his bones back into their basic shape and looked like a man built thin, with muscles that run close to the bone and a face that had forgotten what fear felt like when fingers know which wire to cut.

"Grid sits down on paper," he reported, voice low, breath steady. "APU offline. Defense loops with a friendly line. Captain drinks at five past. Mechanic walks at quarter. Pilot listens to music that sounds like rain and counts starboard bolts when she does. Clerk sleeps with earplugs and keeps a picture of two kids taped to his locker with edges worn from touch."

"Routes," Rook prompted, already turning his head to listen to the vents.

"Two," Sleeve returned. "The forward passage breaks at the mess. The aft steps run past storage and the wash room. I hold the mess. Pike plugs the wash. Lace floats through storage and opens the bridge door from the inside."

The pilot, who the crew called Maud because she liked her names short and useful, checked the time with a glance. "We keep the crew alive," she reminded. "Cold Mother wants ships, not funerals that buy heat."

Pike rolled his shoulders once. "I hear that," he allowed. His voice carried gravel and patience. He pulled a short bag from his pack and snapped it open with two fingers. "Tape, cuffs, gags. We keep it tidy."

They moved.

Sleeve crossed the mess doorway and stood with a hand on the edge of the frame, body half turned like a shadow looking for a better spot to stand. The captain lifted his mug and looked up into a face that nobody would expect to find in that doorway. The moment held a breath. Sleeve had already measured the room and marked the chair legs and the limp in the captain's left ankle. He moved with the speed of someone who knows exactly where his hands want to land. One palm found the collarbone and pressed. The other found the wrist and rotated. The mug hit the table without breaking because Sleeve caught it with the same hand he used to turn the wrist. He eased it down with a neat motion and brought the captain's arm behind his back. "You will lie on the floor," he instructed in a voice that did not rise or tremble. "You will breathe steady. I will count to three because I respect men who follow counts." The captain knew a professional when he met one. He lay down and accepted cuffs without testing them. He had watched enough rooms turn to recognize when pride worsens math.

Pike met the mechanic in the wash room door. The man's hands came up in reflex and met Pike's forearms, which felt like metal pipes under skin now that the suite ran hot. Pike's grip closed on one wrist, and his other hand found the belt and spun the body into the wall without dropping the head. He held the man there with a pressure that explained the choices. "We keep you breathing," he told him. "We keep the ship clean. You hold still and you make that easier for everyone." The mechanic clenched his jaw and nodded once. Pike taped wrists and ankles with a speed that comes from practice and compassion. He fetched a towel, folded it, and tucked it under the man's head because you do that kind of thing when you plan to leave a room without blood.

Lace had crawled into storage and moved through a gap that looked too small until she turned her shoulders and hips in that way of hers, the way that makes men think about cats and then forget the thought because she would have no patience for the comparison. She reached the crawl panel that opens into the bridge service shelf, pried the lip with a short tool, and eased the panel free. The pilot kept her music low enough to taste, not to hear, and Lace used that beat to time her own breath. She slipped through, hung for a second on her fingers, then flowed down like rope. Her feet kissed deck without noise. She stood behind the pilot and let a small sound in her throat carry a shape of words. "Do not reach for anything," she advised, calm and direct. "I will take your hands and I will keep them still. You will breathe. You will count. You will go home alive after I finish the work."

The pilot stiffened, then let her shoulders ease. "You take the ship with clean hands," she returned, humor dry and real. "Fine. I can respect craft."

Lace wrapped the pilot's wrists with cuffs that held firm without cutting circulation. She took the headset from the console and set it on her own head, then used the pilot's chair to reach the shield controls. The bypass read as Sleeve promised. She set a bus to "maintenance" and let it sit there like an honest lie. She fed the ship a quiet line on the tracker that placed them clean on course, then cut the engine commands and let the freighter run down to silent travel on momentum that would last a long half hour. She keyed the cutter and let Maud know the bridge was ready.

Rook took the clerk in the bunk without noise. He folded the man's blanket over his legs and put a strap across his thighs. He lifted the earplugs, smiled, and held up a hand in a simple stop sign that people understand in any language. The clerk froze mid-breath. Rook leaned in and whispered, "You will remember you have children to feed and stories to tell. You will keep that in front of your eyes while I keep your hands behind your back for a short time." The clerk nodded and offered his wrists like a man who has weighed choices and chooses life. Rook tied him with a smooth loop and left enough slack to keep circulation honest. He avoided the photo because he came from men who keep their own photos safe.

Maud stepped onto the bridge and slid into the co-pilot's chair. Lace kept the headset and the console and checked lines twice. Maud watched the numbers and let her hands rest near controls without touching them, which counts as respect in rooms like this. "You nailed the drop," she murmured. "We take two tugs to hold them off if they look. Any angry traffic overhead?"

Rook spoke from the doorway, voice as smooth as a grounded line. "Scan reads clean. The tracker shows normal drift and a ship that looks content with itself. Your window stays open if you move now."

Maud keyed her own line to Sleeve. "Pack the captain and the mechanic in the mess," she directed. "Tie the clerk in his bunk with a pillow under his head. Lace, rig the bridge in standby. We bring the cutter around for a yard tug impression. We look like we belong."

"Acknowledged," Sleeve returned. He lifted the captain and set him on a bench with tape on the ankles and a strap across the chest. He gave the mechanic a bottle of water that he opened first so nobody hurt their teeth on a cap. He checked circulation and loosened a cuff by one notch when skin read purple. He liked clean work because clean work buys long hours.

Pike checked every door with a knuckle and listened for stress in the air. He opened the armory and cleared what little stock a freighter carries: two pistols, one short shotgun, a bag of cuffs, and a baton that someone used three times on rats and once on a man. He unloaded the pistols and the shotgun, placed the shells in a sack, and returned the empty metal to the locker with the keys on top where anyone can see them later. "We leave tools where they belong," he explained to the mechanic, who watched with eyes that had learned respect under labor.

With crew secure and systems quiet, Maud brought the cutter around and docked to the forward tug collar with a neat match-line. The freighter's cameras read the cutter as a friendly profile because Rook had dressed its signature with a code he had bought from a bored yard controller six months earlier and stored in a pocket recorder wrapped in cloth. He tended to wrap important things in cloth. It kept metal from singing against metal. He liked quiet rooms.

They moved fragile steps first, then carried out the plan that follows through the rest of the way. Lace printed a message on the freighter's log in the pilot's voice that handed navigation to "yard assist for vector check." Rook scrubbed the shield events and wrote a tidy maintenance line that would pass a lazy audit and slow a careful one. Sleeve placed panels back with screws turned to the exact flats they had shown before he touched them, because small things keep investigators busy and their bosses patient. Pike swept footprints with a dry mop. He knew that trick from jobs that bought him bread long before Cold Mother found his name.

Maud took the ship under the cutter's gentle pull and turned it one degree off planned course, then two, then five. Space reads generous until authority hears it. They logged an "avoidance vector" that another control room would treat like a weather report. Cold Mother measured risk in seconds and meters as much as in blood and bones. Maud kept meters low and seconds quiet.

They set a rendezvous for a shadowy dock that lived between two rocks with a silent beacon and a panel that flickered only when a friendly code tickled it. The code had cost money and favors. Cold Mother had paid both. The crew worked in silence except for small checks: "Grip," "Tight," "Mark," "Clear." By the time they reached the dock, everyone had earned a stiff drink and a minute to sit.

Before they took that minute, they walked the ship again. Sleeve checked panels with his fingers. Lace checked logs with her eyes. Rook checked air with his ears. Pike checked people with his hand on a shoulder and his eyes reading faces. The captain kept his jaw set but his breath measured. The mechanic gathered anger and put it down because he knew what anger buys. The clerk looked at the floor where his photo lay under Rook's boot and then looked up into a calm face and heard a promise.

"We leave you with oxygen, water, and nav to the nearest station," Rook informed, tone direct. "You will find your tools. You will file your report. You will bring your people home with a story that pays your accounts and keeps you employed. You will mention that the boarding crew kept hands clean and paid small respect. That line helps you more than you think."

The captain exhaled and nodded. "You took a ship with craft," he admitted. "Leave us the beacon. Take what you came for and write careful logs, and I will spend no extra energy on revenge. I have children on a station who prefer fathers to heroes."

"That reads as wisdom," Maud acknowledged. "We share that preference."

They stepped back through the lock and sealed it with a double check. The cutter hung on the collar like a tool in a pegboard. Maud eased it free with a short pulse and drifted into the rock's shadow until the freighter sat alone with its lights even and its story written to move itself home without help. She did not wave. She did not hunt for drama. She steered for the dock with one hand and stripped off her glove with the other to scratch the web between thumb and finger the way she always did when a job wrapped.

They made fast at the hidden pier with small movements and no chatter. A man in a mask and gloves watched from the catwalk and lifted a light twice. Cold Mother's mark does not need a flag. Maud killed power to the external lights because a dock does its best work without drawing attention. Sleeve stretched his arms and legs in a series of small pulls that brought his skeleton back into comfort. He winced once and breathed that wince into a manageable shape. Lace rolled her neck and brushed a hair from her cheek with the back of her wrist because her hands held tape dust. Rook tucked his recorder into cloth and into his jacket. Pike stacked cuffs, tape, and a folded towel into a crate and wrote "salvage" on a tag.

They moved to the cargo bay and stood in a half circle around the sealed rack with the priority code. The rack held a set of small cases with clean corners and locks that prefer numbers to tools. The locks carried the kind of seal that comes from a lab where men take pride in their work and prefer conversation to trouble.

Maud looked at the cases and then at her crew. "We do not open them here," she decided. "We move them clean, collect the rest of the manifest, and buy space before curiosity opens a bill we cannot pay."

"Understood," Sleeve returned. He had cut enough seals to know the sound they make when they become a problem.

Pike lifted the first case with ease that reads like care, not like brag. Lace checked edges for tamper and logged serials with a steady hand and a clean font. Rook handled comms and shadows with the same attention he gives to old radios that still sing on frequency. They worked with an economy that comes from training and respect.

When the last case cleared the freighter and the cutter bay sat empty, Maud permitted herself one line of shop-floor humor. "Business is business," she allowed. "Cold Mother counts on men who deliver when bills arrive."

Rook lifted one eyebrow. "We just brought her receipts," he returned, dry as a winter floor. "She will find that acceptable."

They cut their lines and pushed off the dock with three short bursts. The cutter's nose turned toward a lane that most charts treat as blank. The crew strapped in. Maud kept her hands light on the yoke. Sleeve settled his bones into the shape that fit the seat. Lace tapped a rhythm on her thigh that only she likes. Pike leaned his head back and let his eyes close without dropping guard.

They flew with lights out and a course that moved between public paths like a worker stepping between men who assume they own the room. They let time do its quiet work.

The contents of those cases would turn rooms loud later. For now, the job read clean: a boarded ship, a stripped rack, a crew left breathing with a story that paid their next month, and a dock master who saw nothing because the right numbers walked into the right ledger at the right hour. Cold Mother would stare at the violet work in those cases with the hunger of a person who loves profit more than sleep. Meridian would feel the absence of a delivery that no one had the courage to list by name.

The cutter cleared the rocks and stretched into the dark. Maud counted under her breath and let the count settle her shoulders. Rook watched the noise floor and the tiny spikes that write small truths. Sleeve curled his fingers and made each knuckle pop once, then relaxed his hands. Lace rolled her neck one last time and smiled without showing teeth. Pike checked the straps on the cases the way a man checks the knots on a load before a long road.

They carried a bill that had been forced on them by a loss that someone else caused. Cold Mother preferred short accounts. These men preferred good work. Between those two facts lived an event that would bump Meridian off its script and make certain people reach for phones they had kept buried for years.

They did not speak that thought. They flew. The cutter hummed. Hands rested. Eyes watched. The job moved toward its next page.
