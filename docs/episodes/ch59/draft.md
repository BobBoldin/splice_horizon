**Chapter 59: The Squeeze**

The third planted order cleared before breakfast. Colvern filed it from a different clinic and routed it through a lane that never touched yesterday's desks. The batch number matched. The quantity stayed modest. Elias verified the clinic end with a clean handoff. No fanfare. No flags.

Hale put a steward at the housekeeping corridor with a compact camera tucked in a fire extinguisher shell. Operations authorized the placement without a blink. The steward worked the hall twice an hour, checked the gauge like any other piece of safety gear, and never looked curious.

Joren tuned the pallet scales to a tighter tolerance and logged a baseline on each bay. The numbers displayed stable across three cycles. Any crate that ran heavy would pop with no debate. Dax tuned the tracer console and wrote a little script that printed time, desk, and route on a narrow strip. He taped the strips to the board so anyone could see the pattern at a glance.

By midmorning the first ping arrived. Reconciliation touched the packet. Records room followed with a two-minute hold. The housekeeping router latched for six seconds, then dropped. The camera caught a hand on the latch and a sleeve that matched the grey vest from the night before.

Hale did not grin. She wrote the time and moved to the scales. Bay Four showed a pallet at four kilos over. The boss asked whether a green circle meant good. Hale kept it flat.

"Green only tells you the baseline," she returned. "Run your lift and keep the ticket.

Colvern walked the steward through a narrow brief. "No speeches," she instructed. "You watch, you log, you do not lean in. If they move a crate through that door, you record the face, the tag, and the clock."

The steward nodded and tapped the fake gauge with two fingers, like a man who loved his tools. He respected the part and kept his eyes where they needed to be.

Elias called at noon. He had matched the nephew's old badge activity to a night shift in the bonded complex two levels down. The badge was observed to be active on dates that matched the first clinic's shipment week. He sent a clip of a man entering the service lift with a short dolly and returning with nothing.

"That is your mover," Elias concluded. "He knows the halls and keeps his head down."

"Noted," Draeven returned. "Keep at the plant records. If a die left under a wrong paper, we will want the name who took it."

The Custodian's clerk brought him a list of orders that morning. Two carried the dead batch number. He skimmed the paper, rested a pencil across the lines, and weighed the risk. Burn the line and lose margin, or move one more crate and drown the talk under clean invoices. He chose volume again. He would flood the day with life-extension packs and libido kits. He would ship a modest run of cognitive strips to clinics that loved tidy labels. He would let one coupler pallet slide under housekeeping with a sticker that looked right from five meters.

The wardens used routine for the opposite purpose. Hale walked Bay Four with a loader and checked the hook, the chain, and the drum. She ran a glove across the guard and felt the burr from last week's tool mark. Not proof. Still a sign.

"Keep your feet under you," she told the loader. "You run the rig. If a manager wants a performance, he can use another bay."

The loader grunted and kept his eyes on his line. Men like that carried a dock.

At fourteen hundred, the tracer beeped twice in quick order. Dax looked up sharply. The packet had bounced through the housekeeping router again, then popped out at a small desk labeled document staging. The terminal there was not part of pharmacy flow. It prepped labels and replacement tags for mixed pallets.

"Label house," Dax judged. "That is where they clean the prints."

"Then that is where we want our picture," Colvern returned. "Hale, take the steward and walk that hall. Fire check. Gloves on. If a door opens, we want whatever it will show."

They went without noise. The steward carried the red cylinder. Hale walked with her hands loose and a pace that fit the corridor. The door opened for a handoff inside. The camera caught a printer with two fonts taped to the side and a man lifting a roll of stickers. Another man stamped a time on a tag and slid it into a folder. The lens stayed wide enough to see, tight enough to count.

They did not knock. They did not announce. The door closed. Hale let the steward write a note on his clipboard and they moved on.

Back in the map room, Joren overlaid pallet weights against the tracer pings. Bay Four's heavy crate lined up within ten minutes of the housekeeping latch. Bay Two ran clean. Bay Seven had a weight spike that resolved under a shift to mixed freight. Colvern circled Bay Four and wrote: "bring a proof."

Draeven made three calls. One to operations for a surprise proof lift under steward view. One to the union office for a rep who cared about chain skips for real. One to starport legal for a quiet notice of interest on housekeeping corridor traffic. He used simple words. He kept his tone even. He used phrases that made liability sound real.

By sixteen hundred The rep arrived, opened his notebook, and presented himself to witness the proof. He stood with Hale at Bay Four and watched the hoist run the heavy pallet to a cradle. He signed for a proof. He did not bluster. He understood the pride of a dock and the sting of a cheat.

The pallet landed on the cradle. Dax stepped in with a handheld that checked tag hash and manifest string. The sticker displayed clean. The hash verified. The weight did not match the contents listed. It could be overwrap. It could be dense fittings. It could be anything a man wrote on a form.

"Open for spot check," Hale requested, eyes on the rep.

"Spot check approved," the rep returned. "Manager present. Steward present."

The dock manager came in hot, then cooled when he saw the rep's notebook. He unlocked the band and stood with hands visible. Hale cut the wrapper at two corners and peeled it back. Inside: a grid of fittings that matched the manifest by shape. Under the first layer, another layer. Under that, a cluster of plain boxes with tool consumable codes.

Joren took photos with time and angle printed in the corner. Colvern logged the serials and the box count. Dax kept the handheld on the hash. One box was observed to be one kilo heavier than its twin. He lifted it and tapped the lid with a knuckle. The sound registered dull.

"We need one open," the rep ruled. "Top row, second column. I will sign."

The manager frowned but nodded. "Open it," he allowed, wary of the notebook more than the wardens. He picked the one Dax indicated and cracked the tape. Inside: coupler vials in a foam tray. The model number matched a standard pack. The serial range was off. A collar showed the faint seam of the counterfeit line.

The room did not breathe for one second. Then the steward reached into his pocket and pulled a seal flag. He affixed it to the pallet. The legal observer from starport, who had walked in quiet behind the rep, wrote three lines and placed a hold.

"Pallet held," the observer announced. "No movement until a formal release."

The manager worked his jaw and kept his temper in his mouth. He signed the hold and stared at the false serial. He knew what it meant. He did not have to like how it arrived on his floor.

Draeven exhaled once and spoke low. "We keep it neat," he directed. "We hold chain of custody. We do not turn this into a parade."

Colvern agreed. "I will draft the notice that links housekeeping, records, reconciliation, and this pallet," she offered. "We file it with operations and the steward. No leaks."

The Custodian received a note at his desk that a pallet at Bay Four was under hold. He tapped his pencil against the list and then pressed it flat with his hand. He did not curse. He thought through options. He could contest the hold, but that would draw more eyes. He could start a noise elsewhere, but the wardens had the rep and the legal observer in position. He could move the rest of his stock out the back hall, but the housekeeping camera might catch the face he paid to stay boring. Better to stall, he decided, and move the crown crate later with a different label and a different lift. He picked up the phone, then put it down. Some lines you never call.

Night rolled in on schedule. The wardens split into posts. Hale kept Bay Four under a watch that looked like routine. Dax and Joren rotated at the tracer console. Colvern sat with the steward and wrote the hold notice in clear language. Mira checked with Elias on clinic requests and queued a gentle stall for any order that felt like bait the Custodian could use to paint them as blockers.

The second ping of the night was not a clean latch. It came as a flutter from the housekeeping router, then a handshake from a secondary door two corners down. Joren zoomed the corridor map.

"He is testing a spillover," Joren judged. "A second mouth for times like this."

"Camera there," Hale asked.

"Not yet," Colvern answered. "Give me eight minutes."

Colvern planted a second lens at the spillover door under the same safety pretext. Operations waved her through.

Back in the room, the feed displayed a small slice of hall and a section of door. At 21:03 a key tag flashed. A different clerk stepped out, looked left and right, then wheeled a dolly with two plain boxes toward a lift that served a short shuttle road under the docks. The boxes displayed tool consumable codes. The bottom box rode heavy. The clerk kept his chin tucked. The camera caught his face when he checked the time. The image cleared on the second frame.

"Got you," Dax murmured. "That is not our grey vest. That is the backup."

"Copy the face and the tag," Draeven instructed. "Hale, walk that road. Slow, with a steward. If the boxes move toward a shuttle, we lock the lane with a fork and a clipboard, not a gun."

They went. The steward carried his book. Hale matched his pace and stopped to tie a loose boot lace near the lift. She looked like a person who had worked long on concrete and understood her feet. The dolly squeaked once as the clerk slowed for the corner. Hale stood and stepped into the lane.

"Routine check," she offered mildly. "We have a hold up the line. What are you moving."

"Tool consumables," he returned, too quick. "Going to rework."

"Rework where," the steward asked, pen ready.

"Bay Two," he answered. "Wrong labels. We fix them there."

"Bay Two is closed for inventory," the steward countered, eyes on his page. "Try again."

The clerk blinked, then tried a smile that did not reach the eyes. "I can place them in staging and return with a supervisor."

"Do that," Hale invited. "We will walk with you."

He turned the dolly with care, set the boxes on a low pallet, and checked his band. The indicator light stayed dark. He made a small mistake then. He looked at the housekeeping door, just once, like a man thinking about a path that had worked until today. Hale filed that look in her head.

They let him walk away. They had the face. They had the boxes. They had the lane. A push in that moment would have burned the road they wanted to travel twice more.

Colvern finished the hold notice and handed a copy to the legal observer. The rep initialed the pallet tags and logged the time. Joren printed stills from both corridor cameras and taped them next to the board. Dax pulled the tracer log and stapled the strips to the hold packet. Neat. Boring. Complete.

"Next step," Draeven concluded, "is pressure on paperwork. Operations freezes any crate that routes through housekeeping without a service ticket. The steward posts a rule that lift cameras must display clean time at the top of every hour. Legal issues notice of interest on the label desk. We do not close the room. We make it too bright to work in comfort."

"Done," Colvern returned. "By morning this hallway will feel like a shop with an inspector who loves his job."

The Custodian read two messages in a row. One was the hold at Bay Four. The other listed a new requirement for camera checks and lift seals. He measured the line he had left and the heat he could carry. He could fight on paper, but the wardens had stacked stewards, rep, and legal in a way that paid out. He would have to move his important stock now or lose it under layers of neat forms.

At 23:58 the tracer pinged hard. The second planted order vanished from the public lane and reappeared three minutes later as "fulfilled." No pallet moved under that number. No weight changed on any scale. The housekeeping camera showed the backup clerk enter with a dolly and leave with nothing. The printer desk showed two hands pulling a roll of tags and pressing them into a folder.

"He is swapping numbers," Dax assessed. "Our packet registered as filled while a different crate took the ride."

"Which crate," Joren asked. "Find the weight that moved in that three-minute gap."

Bay Six, two floors down, logged a lift with no ticket. The scale showed a spike and a drop. The camera angle missed the hook by a foot. The hoist ran up, traversed left, and lowered into a hold that served a shuttle run on the far side. The steward there had gone to break at 23:55.

"Housekeeping to Bay Six," Hale traced. "Then out the short road."

"Notify operations to hold Bay Six," Draeven ordered. "Use the words insurance and audit. Tell them the rep is on deck."

Colvern picked up the line and made the call. Operations hesitated, then complied. The hoist froze at deck. The shuttle crew argued for a minute, then backed down when the rep arrived with his book.

They rolled the pallet back onto the scale. Heavy by three. The sticker displayed clean. The hash verified. The serials on the inside boxes would tell the truth. The manager started to object, then stopped when the legal observer showed the hold notice from Bay Four with a matching font error on the counterfeit serials. He put his pen away and unlocked the band.

Hale cut the top wrap and lifted the first layer. Fittings. Second layer. More fittings. Third layer. Plain boxes. Same consumable code. Dax lifted the heavy one and tapped the lid. The sound registered dull again.

"Open it," the rep instructed. "Top row, third from left. I will sign."

The manager slit the tape. Inside: foam trays and coupler vials. The serial range ran out of pattern. The collar seam displayed under bright light. Joren raised the camera for the money shot.

The dock alarm shrieked.

The map room screen flashed three notices at once: fire control alert in bonded records, lift seal fault at housekeeping, and tug release on the Custodian's ship. Dax swore under his breath. Colvern grabbed the nearest handset and reached operations. The line crackled with too many voices. The legal observer looked up, then down, and kept writing. The rep closed his book with his thumb at the last line.

Hale looked at Draeven. He did not raise his voice.

"Split," Draeven directed. "Hale and Joren hold Bay Six with the rep and legal until the tag sits on the pallet. Dax and Colvern with me to records and housekeeping. We lock the doors with the truth we have. Mira, call Elias and push the clinic holds. No new couplers move under suspect serials."

They moved. The hallway lights flickered once, then steadied. A tug horn blew outside. The docking clamps on the Custodian's ship displayed green on a screen and then blanked to black. The housekeeping door camera showed an elbow and a shoulder. The fire alert in records pulsed between amber and red like a clerk who could not decide which story to hold.

Draeven reached the housekeeping door first. He put his palm flat against the metal and felt nothing through the glove. He looked at Colvern. She nodded once and keyed the steward's override. The lock clacked. The door eased.

The room was empty. The bench was clean. The printer sat with a fresh roll mounted and both fonts missing from the side. A single tag lay on the floor, face down. Colvern flipped it with a pen. The number matched the second planted order. The crate tied to it sat three bays away under a shuttle ramp that had begun to rise.

"Power to that ramp," Draeven ordered, voice calm and flat. "Operations, cut the lift. Rep, hold your pen. Legal, keep your copy running."

The intercom returned a broken line and a single answer no one wanted to hear at that hour.

"Power controls are unresponsive," the operator reported. "Manual override failed. Tug authority just transferred. The ship is moving."

The ship began to move, power unresponsive and alarms talking over each other. The wardens had their proof pinned to pallets and cameras; the Custodian had tug authority and a clock.
