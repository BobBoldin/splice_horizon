Chapter 19 - Hunger In The Stack

Weeks passed under steady lights and short windows. The records built a shape anyone could read. Base mesh subjects held steady on long intervals. The only recurring change there sat in the heat column. Yearly maintenance covered it. Attribute splices were different. Stability lasted until it did not. When the interval arrived, the drift came on hard.

Second watch. Coolant Bay Two runs cold and loud. Piping rises three decks. Catwalks cross like a grid. Frost rings each valve stem. Yellow boxes mark the hand wheels. The emergency dump is banded red. The smell is clean metal and treated water. Every voice carries in here whether a person means it to or not.

Geir walks the high catwalk with a two-person crew, routine inspection with a pressure check at the midpoint. He stops mid-step and grips the rail. Blink rate jumps, then locks. He draws a breath that looks like he is trying to pull more air than the bay holds. The crew lead starts to ask a standard question and drops it when Geir does not answer.

"Geir, are you with me?" the lead tries again.

No response. Geir's eyes fix on the red dump wheel across the span like that circle is the only thing left to look at. His shoulders square to it.

On the deck, a tech watches the overhead feed and reaches for the bay alarm. The tone hits hard and short. Heads lift. Colonel Rane is finishing a walk-through in the next bay and is already moving before the second tone sounds. She does not run. She carries speed with purpose that makes other people get out of the way.

In the medical bay, Kaela is logging a maintenance calendar when the hall comm clicks. Her voice is clear. "Coolant Bay Two. Attribute splice drifting. Looks like Geir."

Elias takes the Ferronox case off the shelf without speaking. He steps into the corridor and sets a quick pace that does not waste breath. Kaela meets him halfway with the coupler coil and both bands. They do not trade talk. There is nothing useful to say between here and the next turn.

Inside the bay, Rane's voice cuts through the machine noise with clipped orders. "Clear the deck. Seal the red line. Keep the valve path open. Do not crowd him."

Geir's crew lead reaches for the back strap of his harness. Geir shakes him off without looking. It is not a hit and not a shove. He just decides that strap is not part of his plan and keeps moving. He takes one deliberate step toward the red wheel.

"Stop right there," Rane calls from the deck. "Hands to the rail."

He pauses for a heartbeat, then takes another step. The lead grabs the strap again. Geir drags him half a pace before the lead lets go. A second person reaches forward and then thinks better of it.

Kaela climbs the ladder opposite Geir's position. She keeps the coil slung cross-body and her profile small. Elias climbs to the lower landing under Geir's section and brings the metronome unit to life. The tick is steady. He turns the volume until it sits inside the room without fighting the noise.

He keeps his tone even and strong. "Geir, eyes on me. Hands stay where they are."

Geir's head turns a fraction. His eyes flick to Elias, then back to the wheel. His jaw tightens. Sweat stands on his forehead. The room temperature does not excuse it. He is cold by any basic reading. The sweat belongs to a different column entirely.

Kaela reaches the catwalk and leans on the rail two spans away. "Band," she says without raising her voice.

Elias tosses one up. She catches it and opens the clasp. He snaps the second around his own forearm and climbs two more rungs. They come to a stop with two meters between them and Geir. Closing that gap early is how a person gets thrown against the uprights by a subject who is not aware he is throwing anyone.

Geir breathes like the count he learned is gone. His shoulders hitch at the top of each inhale. His right hand opens and closes like he is trying to feel a tool that is not there. He steps once more toward the red wheel. His fingers come off the rail two centimeters and find it again.

Rane keeps her voice level. "You spin that valve and you crack the line, Geir. That pull you feel is not a choice. Stand still."

He shakes his head once, hard, as if something stung him. Both hands clamp down on the rail. The pause is short. Mere seconds. It is enough.

Elias sets the cadence in his own body first. He lifts his banded forearm where Geir can see it and shows an open hand. He does not reach. He does not rush. He speaks with caution that fits the moment.

"I know," he says to the tightness written across Geir's face. "Stay with the count. No one is going to move you. In on four. Out on six."

Kaela braces the coil housing on the rail between them. "On your count," she says.

"Three," Elias answers. "Two. One."

They snap the bands at the same time. One claps shut on Geir's forearm. One stays firm on Elias. Kaela seats the coupler to the rail, checks the small indicator, and presses the housing in to keep contact clean. The light shifts from red to amber. Not enough yet. Close.

"In on four," Elias says, and lets the number carry like a metronome. "One, two, three, four. Out on six. One, two, three, four, five, six."

Geir fights the first cycle. His chest wants to pick a different pace. Habit pulls him back. He has trained under this voice in a bright room with a clock. Amber flicks to green for a heartbeat and back to amber again. His grip eases a fraction.

"Again," Elias says. "Stay here. You are going to be perfectly fine."

Kaela watches both the coil indicator and the hand that could still forget the rail. She does not waste words. If she has to call a change, she will call it in a tone that leaves no doubt. Rane stands on the deck with one hand up and palm open. It is a clear signal to anyone who thinks about moving. Do not.

Green holds for a full second. Geir blinks hard and finds his tongue. "My head still feels tight, like some over inflated balloon."

Elias keeps the pace steady. "I know. No one is expecting you to maneuver on your own. We are right here to help you."

Two seconds of green. The jaw slackens a notch. Eyes come off the wheel and land on Elias's open palm. He mirrors the breath again. Four in. Six out. The indicator steadies and holds.

Kaela nods once. The motion is small and meant for Elias, not for anyone watching a feed.

They ease the pressure off the coupler without breaking contact. The light holds green. Geir closes his eyes and keeps the count. When he opens them again, the focus sits behind them instead of at a fixed point across the span.

He swallows and clears his throat. "What the crap was that about anyhow?"

Elias answers simply. "You missed your regular dosing appointment. Fortunately, we caught this episode quickly enough that nobody was hurt. We will just chalk this incident up to no harm no foul."

Geir looks down at the red wheel, then at Rane. A color that does not belong to cold rooms hits his face. He drops his shaking hand and covers it with the other to hide the movement.

"More garbage I must worry about now. It makes me wonder which is worse, the disease or this supposed cure. Anyhow, am I finished here?" His voice scrapes like he ran hard.

Rane's reply carries across the bay. "Up there, yes. Down the ladder with two escorts. You are not released yet."

Kaela opens the band and hands it back without flourish. Elias does the same. They keep the coupler on the rail until Geir starts down, then she breaks contact, coils the cable, and shoulders the kit. The path on the deck opens without anyone needing to call it out. People know to move when a person is coming down with a look like that on his face.

Elias takes Geir's shoulder. The contact is light and direct. He guides him to the bench by the console and sits him down. Kaela places a warm pack in his hands. He grips it hard and draws a slow breath that finally matches the one he practiced on the catwalk.

Rane steps in front of him. Her tone leaves no edges for argument. "Observation for the rest of the watch. No solo assignments for forty-eight hours. We will set your calendar in the lab. We are not waiting for this again."

Geir stares at the warm pack and nods once. He does not trust his mouth yet. His jaw works a second time and then settles. "The lights, I hate going to the damn clinic. I thought I could stretch it," he manages. "I felt fine until I didn't."

Elias answers before the shame can spread. He keeps it practical. "You can\'t manage this alone. Base mesh holds on long intervals. Attribute splices do not. When the interval hits, the system demands renewal. Grabbing the nearest big red knob is how the people in the bay get hurt. We keep this inside the lab and on a schedule that you agree to with us. I\'m sure we can find a room with dim lights for you."

Rane turns slightly so the whole crew hears it, not just Geir. "No one self-maintains. No hallway advice. If you feel a pull, you go to the lab. That rule goes on every board and in every briefing."

The deck crew around the console stand still and listen because the words are clear and simple. No one wants to be the name attached to the next alarm.

Kaela opens the console slate and writes the incident header in plain terms so the report matches what the cameras showed. **Attribute splice drift, Coolant Bay Two. Intervention: Ferronox coupling. Outcome: stabilized on-site.** She adds two lines under it that carry more weight than they look. **Term: Maintenance Interval. Mitigation: scheduled renewals, taper ladders, supervised pauses.**

Geir lifts the warm pack to his face and lets the heat set him back in his seat. The shake leaves his hands. His breathing finds a normal count. He looks at Elias with the flat honesty of a person who just met a wall he did not believe in until now. "I do not remember deciding to step toward the wheel."

"That was instinct, just not one you had before." Elias says. He keeps his voice low so it stays with Geir and does not turn into a speech. "That was drift. We will not let you get that far again."

Rane looks at the overhead camera and then at the crew. "Back to stations. Keep the valve path clear until the log completes." The room finds its noise again. The frost rings on the stems look the same as they did at the start of the watch. Nothing cracked. No water on the floor. The new marks are in the file and in the way people will talk about this bay for a week.

Kaela keeps pace with Elias as they carry the kit back out. She secures the coil with a strap so it does not swing. "He took the count fast, didn\'t he?"

"Training paid for itself," Elias replies. The metronome unit rests silent in the case now, but the memory of the count stays in his ribs.

Rane reaches the corridor with them. She does not lower her voice. "Post the rule before the next watch. Schedule renewals now. I do not want another pull like that in a high-risk bay."

"You will have both," Elias says. He does not make it sound like an offer. "Base mesh stays on the long calendar. Attribute splices move to maintenance. We write the plan with each subject. We do not hand it to them like a penalty."

"I can defend that," Rane answers. Defense matters because she will carry this into rooms where people do not want to hear about limits. She needs clean words that hold under pressure.

They pass through the bulkhead and into the cooler quiet of the main corridor. The vent hiss is steady. The deck vibration is steady. Normal helps after a room like that. Kaela hands the band back to Elias and checks the clasp out of habit. He tucks both bands into the case and presses the latches until they click.

Back in the medical bay, they lay the kit on the table by the center station. Elias writes the header line first so no one can pretend they did not see it. **Attribute splices carry a maintenance interval. When you cross it, the stack pulls hard. Come to the lab. Do not improvise.** He pins it so it sits at the top of each subject's file. He adds the policy line under it with the same plain tone that worked in the bay. **No unsupervised maintenance. No hallway advice. Pauses and renewals happen in the lab with consent recorded.**

Kaela updates the calendar board. Names slide one row at a time to line up with the new intervals. She speaks the schedule aloud for the recorder so the audio file matches the visual line. "Geir, maintenance at seventy-two hours, then reassess. Dami, check-in at one week. Rocha, hold at monthly pending tests."

Elias pulls the incident footage from the bay camera and scrubs to the moment Geir lifts his hand off the rail. He does not watch it twice. Once is enough to see the start of the pull. He tags the frame for training and writes a short description that will prevent arguments later. *Subject's gaze locked to emergency wheel at 00:10. Right hand released rail at 00:12. Coupling applied at 00:16. Stabilized by 00:38. No damage. No injuries.*

He stands, sets the pen down, and lets his shoulders drop. For a moment he allows the idea that they caught a worst day before it began. The next thought follows without any help. There are six other names in the attribute column. Each will reach a point like this in their own time. The interval will not respect maintenance hours or holidays. The only answer is a rule that holds and training that does not leave people alone with their own stack.

Kaela finishes the board and looks toward the doorway. "Do you want me to brief Bay Two and Bay Three supervisors, or do you want to do it yourself?"

"Both," Elias says. "You take Bay Three now. I will take Bay Two. We keep the phrasing simple and the questions open. If someone tries to argue this is a rumor, we point at today's log."

She nods. "I will keep it short."

"Short and clear saves lives," he says.

Before she goes, she pauses at the edge of the workstation. "Base mesh cases still look clean," she says. "Mom's group holds on the long interval. Heat-side effects only."

"That matches what we saw," Elias replies. He does not add anything about the way a room feels different when Liora steps into it. That does not belong in a lab note and it does not belong in a briefing. It belongs to a different part of life, and he keeps those thoughts separate on purpose.

Elias looks at the board one more time. The new term sits at the top in plain letters. **Maintenance Interval.** It is not dramatic. It will change the schedule of the ship and the way people think about themselves. That is what the right word does when it is used at the right time.

He takes the case to the storage shelf and sets it down with care that is not superstition. Tools last longer when a person treats them right. He closes the cabinet. Kaela is already halfway down the corridor with her slate in hand, ready to explain a rule in a way that leaves no space for rumor.

The day continues. The bay where it happened goes back to work. The rest of the ship learns a new phrase and a new habit. And in the files, beside Geir's name, there is a clean line anyone can read without color or guesswork:

*Interval reached. Coupling applied. Stabilized. Calendar set. No improvisation.*
