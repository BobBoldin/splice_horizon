Chapter 36 --- Shock Front

Back in the debris field, the clean numbers vanished in a blink, and the anchor yanked hard enough to pull breath from Aria's chest. A flash flared under the plate, a tight concussion ran through the tether, and a flat crack snapped across the headsets as the proximity mine fired its scatter load. Keon spun through a shower of glittering shards, Aria grabbed for his shoulder ring and caught air, and Elian curled over the collar with his arms braced to keep the bite true.

Shrapnel scythed past on shallow angles and found Tomas at the forearm, punching through his suit near the flex seam and spraying frost along the cut as vapor raced out. A second burst of fragments sliced across Keon's waist line and clipped his tether clean, sending him into a slow, widening arc that carried him away from the work face with the coil trailing like a flag under starlight. Lysa's breath hitched once and then steadied as muscle memory took her hands to the kit: one patch pad for Tomas, one hard-throw line for Keon, and a timer slap that turned her slate into a metronome for the next minute.

"Anchor holds," Elian announced through clenched teeth, shoulders locked while the line loaded and settled. "Bite reads true with a half degree of twist on the face." He eased his weight into the collar as the plate shuddered again and then quieted under proof, jaw tight and eyes on the torque marks like a man holding a door for a crowd during a fire.

"Keon, face me and kick once on my count," Aria instructed, lamp steady on his visor so his brain kept a horizon. "Three, two, one." He drove a clean kick and stalled the spin by a hair, arms tucked and hands working to square his chest to her light while the cut tether whipped past and traced an ugly spiral.

Lysa crossed to Tomas in two pulls and planted the patch pad over the seam with a heel of her glove, then traced the edges to warm the gel and seal the leak while she watched his face for that faraway look that means oxygen drops faster than language can track it. "You stay with me," she urged, voice firm rather than loud. "Grip my wrist and squeeze. Once, then twice." His fingers closed in a steady rhythm and came back for the second squeeze with a touch of stubborn pride that gave her permission to move.

Tomas drew a breath and glanced at his console, then brought the handheld up for a quick sweep even as the sealant set. "Triplex stays clean on the field," he reported, eyes flicking between numbers and the arc that carried Keon farther out. "Couplers read green and stand ready under default."

Aria tracked Keon's drift line and felt the cold part of her brain lay out distances and time like blocks on a bench. "We go to windows," she ordered, tone crisp to keep everyone's minds inside the work. "Grip boost for me on a short span, steady-hand for Keon, oxygen for Tomas across the seal set. Lysa, run the clock. Tomas, confirm profiles."

"Profiles up," Tomas answered, then flinched as the patch popped and fully seated. He cleared his throat and read the board. "Aria: grip boost thirty seconds. Keon: steady-hand thirty seconds with taper. Tomas: oxygen support one minute with taper. Dosage control set to clinic defaults."

Keon's arc widened by another meter, and the tug in Aria's chest turned into a hard, simple line: bring him home or watch him leave. "Engage," she directed.

The couplers clicked green across three chests. Aria felt forearm tendons wake like a tightened net and fingers steady into a calm hold. Keon's micro-tremor eased, vision sharpened on the lamp, and breath found a rhythm he could stack a plan on. Tomas's cheeks filled again as the oxygen bump landed, and the gray at the edge of his vision pulled back enough to give him three clean thoughts in a row.

"Throw," Aria called, and Lysa's rescue line left her hand in a flat arc that crossed Keon's path with a touch of extra lead built in for the field's slow pull. Keon timed the catch, opened his palm at the last instant, and clamped down with the calm, heavy grip the window delivered, chest square to her light and legs set for the small kick that would finish the job.

The mine's secondary charge pulsed then, a late bloom that threw another wash of fragments across their cone. A sliver kissed Aria's thigh panel and scored the outer plate. A wider shard rang off Elian's shoulder and kicked a torque mark half a degree out. Three pellets struck Lysa's pack with sharp pops that she filed away for later because the line in her hand carried Keon's life for the next five seconds.

"Line on," Keon reported, forearms tight and elbows close as he pulled into the slack she gave him. Aria fed the recover by hand, taking the strain in a smooth, even draw, and felt the grip boost hold steady as the muscles in her forearms carried a load that would normally chatter through the bones. She kept her jaw loose and counted through her teeth because counts beat fear when the world starts to move too fast.

Tomas blinked once to clear the damp at the edge of his vision and checked his slate. The oxygen window ticked down toward taper, and the numbers around the patch held in a narrow band that promised the seal would last through the minute. He ran a quick scan on Keon's coupler to confirm the steady-hand remained inside the usage limit, then checked Aria's grip window and found a clean curve that would land without a rebound.

Keon drifted closer, arm over arm on the line with the measured pull of a man who knows how much of himself to spend in the first ten seconds and how much to save for the last five. Aria anchored her boots against a spar and took his weight into her harness, shoulders square and wrists quiet, and the two of them built a small bridge back to the work face while the field around them flickered with dust and slow shards.

A thin whine rose inside Keon's helmet as the mine's proximity lattice spent itself in a last, ragged wave, and the hair along his forearms prickled inside the suit liner. "Field still hot," he warned, voice even. "One more pulse likely."

"Understood," Aria returned. "On me for the last two pulls." She took a hand over hand draw and brought him within reach, then locked a glove on his shoulder ring and used a hip shift to swing him inside her cone. He moved with her, found the rhythm, and landed against the spar with a thud that felt like relief rather than impact.

Lysa looked up from Tomas and tracked the timer with the kind of attention that turns seconds into room to work. "Windows at five," she announced, giving them a count that matched the burn in forearms and lungs. "Aria's grip lands first, then Keon's steady-hand, then Tomas's oxygen."

"Copy," Aria answered, and eased her fingers a fraction to feel the strength settle back toward baseline. She gave Keon's shoulder ring one last check and glanced to the anchor face.

Elian held the collar through the whole storm and now watched the twist mark with hawk stillness. Sweat traced a line along his temple inside the helmet, and his voice came through with the gravel of strain that had stayed inside the safety boundary by will and training. "Bite still true," he reported. "Proof holds at twenty. Face wants a small correction on the next rise."

The repeater clicked once on the rim and then steadied. Tomas checked his board and watched Aria's window close on schedule, Keon's taper descend through a gentle slope, and his own oxygen curve settle without a snapback that would sour the next minute. He flexed his patched forearm and found sensation where he needed it, then gripped the handheld with a focus that left no room for pride.

Then the couplers threw a red bar across Lysa's slate: Keon's grip boost request stacked over a fresh hip reinforcement call as he braced for the line's recoil, while Aria queued a short oxygen push for the correction pull. The device refused the stack and held the locks with clinic discipline, and the timer marched forward while the anchor waited for people to decide.

"Stacked windows blocked," Tomas reported, eyes tight on the board as the red bar held. "Couplers enforce single-profile sequence under current settings."

Lysa saw the geometry in one breath: a loaded line that asked for hips and hands together, a correction pull that wanted a small oxygen lift for Aria, and a field still throwing sparks around their edges. She planted her boots, braced her shoulder against the spar, and made a call that carried clean across the loop. "Override to controlled stack," she ordered. "Keon receives hip reinforcement at fifteen seconds with a hard taper, Aria receives a ten-second oxygen lift tied to the correction count. Anchor protocol holds. Abort threshold remains live."

Tomas met her eyes through the glass and read the weight she had already put on the decision. "Confirming override," he replied, and his thumb slid the cover off the manual gate. He keyed the sequence with a deliberate touch that left room for a second thought and then finished it because half-steps waste lives. "Override active. Profiles constrained by timer. Logs capture full sequence."

"Keon, brace for the correction pull," Aria called, setting her feet and squaring her hips.\
"Elian, watch the anchor plate and tell me left or right.\
Brant, hold your pull and stand ready to feather two percent on my mark."

"Ready and braced," Keon replied, jaw firm and breath on a steady count.

"The plate needs a small move left," Elian reported, eyes fixed on the torque marks.\
"A half degree brings the alignment home."

"Standing by to feather," Brant confirmed, his channel steady and clear.

"On my count," Lysa called, voice even and strong.\
"Three, two, one."

The second set of splices hit as the stacks engaged: Keon's hips locked into a controlled brace that turned muscle into a stable frame, Aria's chest filled with a short, clean lift that sharpened vision and steadied hands, and Elian watched the correction land like a key turning in a well-cut lock. Shards pinged off plates, a thin crack ran along the useless end of Keon's severed tether, and the anchor face settled to true under a rise that felt like a held breath finally let go.

Aria held the line through the taper and then released to the mark, eyes scanning for fresh motion while her pulse slowed in deliberate steps. Keon unclenched fingers one at a time, felt the brace fade to baseline, and breathed through a small tremor that rode the edge of his skin before it departed. Tomas checked his patch again and took an inventory of what still hurt; the list felt honest and manageable. Lysa watched the curves land and the red bar fade, then released the manual gate and tapped a note that wrote responsibility in clear letters she would own in any room.

"Proof holds at twenty and reads ready for the next rise," Elian concluded, voice raw but steady. "Collar remains clean. Plate sits flush."

Aria swallowed and tasted copper at the back of her throat from exertion and grit in the air mix. "We hold for thirty and reassess all counts," she directed, eyes moving from face to face and then to the numbers that would govern the next choice. "Mark injuries for medical bay, log the override, and breathe through a full cycle before anyone reaches for a tool."
