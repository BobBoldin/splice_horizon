Chapter 10 -- First Splice

Morning in the tissue wing, the day after the cooling period. The lab lights rose by small steps and held steady. Filters whispered. Trays sat in clean rows. The room kept its patient rhythm.

Maris Delane waited in the consent room with Advocate Serano. The door stood open to the lab so voices could carry without strain. Clerk Evan Trusell held his slate, the recorder light set to blue. Elias Tharros and Mira Jeylan entered with sleeves rolled and hands dry.

Serano spoke first. "Maris, do you confirm your consent to proceed with today's limited application and observation."

"I do," Maris said. "I consent."

Trusell tapped the time. "Consent confirmed," he said. "Cooling period complete. Session begins."

"Thank you," Elias said. "Mira, baselines and imaging."

Vitals came fast and clean. Breath, pulse, pressure, oxygen. Mira guided Maris to the scan chair and brought the lesion window up on the wall. Grain by grain, the image sharpened into a map of vessels near the Spiral margin. One thread along the inner arc showed a pale bloom at each pulse. The wall there looked thin and tired.

"Target selected," Mira said. "Peripheral branch at the margin. Deterioration present. Access is safe through a small field."

Elias studied the frame. "We will seat the Sunfan film as a cuff over that branch," he said. "Purpose today is structural support and signal clarity. No payload is set. We will learn what it can carry later."

Kaela stepped in and placed a tray by the sink. "Clean wraps," she said. "Tea is in the next room."

"Thank you," Mira said. "We will start now."

Under the hood, a warm plate waited. Mira opened a sterile case and lifted a thin translucent sheet with forceps. The film looked like nothing at first, then it took a hint of shape as heat reached it.

"Sunfan ridge polymer," she said for the record. "Softens at body warmth. Forms a basal layer that flexes with movement. We will cut a narrow strip and pre-curve it for a cuff."

Elias drew a quiet breath and centered his focus. Liora's chart pinged across the room and fell silent. He kept his eyes on the work. "Proceed," he said.

Mira trimmed the film to a ribbon and eased it across a small curved guide. The strip settled into a gentle arc. She set out the micro coupler, the enzyme edge brush, sensor dots the size of seeds, and a plain dressing. Tools in order kept the mind clear.

"Local prep," Mira said. She cleaned skin over the target field, waited the proper count, and set a narrow sterile frame. "You will feel cool and then warm," she told Maris. "Speak at once if the warmth climbs."

Maris nodded. "I will."

Under the scan, the vessel pulsed with a thin, unsteady beat. Mira made a short superficial window, exposed the branch through a clear gel, and placed two tiny anchors that kissed the outer tissue and held position. The work moved slow and sure.

"Cuff placement," Elias said for the recorder. "Micro coupler ready."

Mira lifted the pre-curved strip with forceps and slid it around the vessel at the thinning point. The Sunfan film softened fully at contact. Edges met with a clean seam. Mira touched the seam with the micro coupler. The tool made a soft tick as the interface took hold. A second tick followed along the curve. The cuff seated like a ring that had always belonged there.

"Seat is clean," Mira said. "Edge is smooth. No shear at the moment."

Elias watched the live trace. The pale bloom at each pulse eased down by a small measure. The waveform steadied. "Record that change," he said. "Begin shallow breath and cough test."

Maris breathed in, then out through slightly parted lips. She gave one short cough. The cuff flexed and returned. No gap showed at the seam.

"Apply a narrow enzyme coat to the outer edge," Elias said. "Border control only."

Mira drew a thin circle at the cuff edge with the lichen enzyme. The line settled and became a neat margin. "Border set," she said. "No wicking beyond the mark."

Elias touched the sensor reader. A seed-dot set just outside the seam woke and gave a steady number. "Signal is clear," he said. "Noise falls a little. Flow at the branch normalizes by a small percentage."

"Warmth at the site," Maris said. "Low. Even."

"Scale it, please," Mira said.

"Two," Maris said. "No change so far."

Mira cooled the surface for a breath and lifted the pack. "Holding steady," she said. "No discoloration. No fluid at the anchors."

They stood quiet for a minute and watched the trace draw its clean line. Elias let the stillness do its work, then spoke for the room. "Primary objective achieved. Cuff remains seated. Vessel wall holds shape through pulse and breath. We will monitor for forty eight hours. No additional action today."

Trusell wrote while he listened. "Observation schedule," he said, ready to read back.

"Set continuous telemetry," Elias said. "Nurse checks at two hours, six hours, and twelve hours. Full review at twenty four hours and again at forty eight hours. If warmth climbs above four on ten, if tingling radiates, or if the trace drifts beyond the set band, call the team at once."

Mira covered the field with a clear barrier and laid a plain dressing. The anchors released with a soft give and left the skin clean. "You did well," she told Maris. "We will move you to observation with Advocate Serano."

Maris exhaled through her nose and gave a small nod. "Thank you," she said.

Serano placed a hand near, not on, Maris's arm. "I will sit with you," she said. "If you wish to pause at any point, say so and we will pause."

Trusell checked the board again. "Scheduling," he said.

"Yes," Elias said. "Begin the next set of intakes three days from today. One volunteer per session. Space each session by three days. Tribunal present for each. Advocate present and recorded. No changes to dose or scope until the forty eight hour review."

"Logged," Trusell said. "Three days hence, then every three days."

Mira sealed the used tools in a tray and set the sample plate to a timed assay. "Analysis will run in the background," she said. "We will have early curves by evening."

Elias looked across the room to the screen that held Liora's chart. He kept his hands on the bench. "Thank you, all," he said. "Maris goes to observation. We hold the field stable and watch."

Kaela gathered the wrappers and carried the tray out with quiet steps. The room kept its steady hum. The cuff on the small vessel flexed with each breath and stayed seated, a simple ring doing a simple job while the ship counted time.

Evening in the small operations chamber. The door sealed. Paper filters breathed. One recorder light glowed blue.

Commander Aric Veynar sat at the narrow end of the table. Councillor Hollis Venner and Councillor Kaldor Mirea took the left and right. Director Amaris Colvern set her case down and folded her hands. Clerk Evan Trusell stood with his slate.

Veynar began. "Phase Beta, delivery step, subject Maris Delane. Status is stable. Adhesion holds. Forty eight hour observation is underway."

"Resources," Colvern said. "You have material for five patients this cycle. You have three volunteers."

"Correct," Veynar said. "We need two more."

Venner looked to Trusell. "Read the Charter section for shortfall."

Trusell scrolled and read in a clear voice. "Continuance Rotation, Section Fifteen. When volunteer count fails to meet a scheduled medical trial that carries community value, the ship may draw from households with open medical service obligations under the Venture Bond. The draw is based on a rotation. A household may present a substitute volunteer of equal or closer indication. Minors are barred. Hardship cases may seek relief through the Advocate panel. All selections require Tribunal consent."

Mirea tapped the table once. "We have used this for immunization cycles and forward staffing," he said. "We have not used it for first-in-human."

Colvern's eyes stayed steady. "This is a community trial with the ship's future in view," she said. "The bond permits the rotation."

Veynar listened to the air move and chose his words. "We will use the rotation with every guard we have," he said. "No performance splice. Delivery and sensing only. Advocate in the room. Tribunal present. Households may send a substitute who meets the indication. We will not harm trust for speed."

Venner nodded. "Name the steps."

"First," Veynar said, "post the notice with exact scope and the calendar. Second, call the households with open obligations, beginning with those who flagged willingness in prior screenings. Third, open the hardship window for a full day. Fourth, seat the Advocate panel to hear relief requests. Fifth, schedule intakes at three day intervals until we reach five."

"Funding ties to measurable progress," Colvern said. "I want weekly briefs with signal quality, adhesion rates, and adverse events, even if the numbers move by small degrees."

"You will have them," Veynar said. "Clerk, mark the schedule. The next intake is three days from today. Then every three days until five are complete."

"Logged," Trusell said. "Notices will quote Section Fifteen and list relief steps in plain speech."

A tone sounded at the door. Serano, the Patient Advocate, stepped in at Veynar's request and took the empty chair.

"Advocate," Veynar said, "we are short two subjects. We will start the Continuance Rotation. We need you to chair hardship review, confirm every consent, and keep the line bright."

"I will," Serano said. "The process will be clear. People will see the door they can use to step forward, and the door they can use to step back."

Mirea turned a page on his folio. "The crew should hear one human voice as well as policy," he said. "Say it from the bridge."

Veynar gave a single nod. "I will address the ship after this meeting."

Trusell's slate chimed. He glanced down. "A fourth volunteer is at the Advocate window," he said. "Name submitted. Mid-stage, fits indication."

Serano checked a second screen and gave a small, satisfied breath. "I know her," she said. "She helped in hydroponics during the last outage. She understands what consent is. I will take her into counsel."

"That fills four," Venner said. "One remains."

Colvern lifted her case and clicked the latch shut. "Post the rotation at once," she said. "Keep the promise of a narrow scope. Deliver clean data. The budget follows the proof."

"The rotation will run with care," Veynar said. "We end the session on that."

Trusell marked the close. The recorder light faded. The door unsealed with a soft release.

Veynar stepped to the shipwide mic outside the chamber. He waited until the channel settled. Then he spoke in the steady voice that the crew recognized.

"Ship," he said, "this is Commander Veynar. Phase Beta began today with a delivery layer that supports a single vessel at the edge of a Spiral lesion. We will watch for forty eight hours. We need two more subjects to complete this cycle. We will follow the Continuance Rotation under Section Fifteen. Households with open obligations will be called in order. You may send a substitute if that person fits the medical indication. Minors are barred. If your household faces hardship, the Advocate panel will hear you. Consent remains the center. The scope remains delivery and sensing. We do this together and we do it with care."

He closed the channel.

In the Wardens' bay, Dax Morlin signed out a low-impact capture kit for a juvenile hammer tail plate core. He checked straps, nets, and the shock frame, then pressed his thumb to the tag and set the case on the bench.

In the lab, Mira sterilized the loom arms and set the tray for the next intake. She spoke low to Elias without lifting her eyes from the work. "We will have four if the Advocate confirms," she said. "The rotation will give us the fifth."

Elias watched the cuff pulse with Maris's breath on the monitor. "Schedule holds," he said. "We move one patient at a time."

Kaela passed the corridor and saw the notice print onto a wall screen: a clear block of text with dates, contact, and the Advocate's office lit in bold. People stopped and read. Some took a picture. One person touched the screen and then stepped away to think.

Serano met the new volunteer in the quiet room by the Advocate desk. Two chairs. One table. No hurry.

"Tell me your name," Serano said, warm and steady.

The woman folded her scarf and set it on her lap. "I am ready to help," she said. "I know what I sign. Please take my name."

The ship adjusted its evening lights. The Wayfarer bay dimmed to service level. The cuff on Maris's vessel held its seat. The clock for forty eight hours began to mean something. The ledger for the rotation wrote its first line.
