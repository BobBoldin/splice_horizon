Chapter 10 -- First Splice

"Morning in the tissue wing, the day after the cooling period. The lab lights rose by small steps and held steady. Filters whispered. Trays sat in clean rows. The room kept its patient rhythm."

Maris Delane waited in the consent room with Advocate Serano. The door stood open to the lab so voices could carry without strain. Clerk Evan Trusell held his slate, recorder light set to blue. Elias Tharros and Mira Jeylan entered with sleeves rolled and hands dry.

Serano raised the form and kept her tone plain, "Maris, do you confirm your consent to proceed with today's limited application and observation?"

Maris met her eye, "I do. I consent."

A quick tap marked the time, "Consent confirmed. Cooling period complete. Session begins," Trusell logged.

Elias gestured to the scanners, "Mira, baselines and imaging."

Vitals came fast and clean: breath, pulse, pressure, oxygen. The scan chair took Maris's weight while the lesion window climbed the wall. Grain by grain, a map of vessels near the Spiral margin came clear. Along the inner arc, one thread showed a pale bloom at each pulse. The wall there looked thin and tired.

Mira marked the frame with a fingertip, "Target selected. Peripheral branch at the margin where deterioration is present. Access is safe through a small field."

Elias studied the contour and kept it spare, "We will seat the Sunfan film as a cuff over that branch. Purpose today is structural support and signal clarity. No payload is set. We will learn what it can carry later."

Kaela slid a tray to the sink, "Clean wraps. Tea is in the next room."

Mira nodded once, "We will start now."

Under the hood, a warm plate waited. A sterile case opened; forceps lifted a thin translucent sheet that took a hint of shape as heat reached it.

"For the record, Sunfan ridge polymer," Mira narrated. "Softens at body warmth and forms a basal layer that flexes with movement. We will cut a narrow strip and pre-curve it for a cuff."

Elias drew a quiet breath and centered his focus. Liora's chart pinged once and fell silent. Eyes stayed on the work, "Proceed."

A ribbon trimmed to width eased across a small curved guide and settled into a gentle arc. Tools lined in order---micro coupler, enzyme edge brush, seed-dot sensors, plain dressing---kept the mind clear.

"Local prep," Mira noted. Skin over the target field was cleaned, count observed, a narrow sterile frame set. "You will feel cool and then warm," she told Maris. "Speak at once if the warmth climbs."

"I will."

Under scan, the vessel pulsed with a thin, unsteady beat. A short superficial window opened; clear gel exposed the branch. Two tiny anchors kissed the outer tissue and held position. The work moved slow and sure.

Elias flagged the recorder, "Cuff placement. Micro coupler ready."

Mira looped the pre-curved strip around the vessel at the thinning point. The Sunfan film softened fully at contact. Edges met in a clean seam. The micro coupler touched and gave a soft tick as the interface took hold, then another along the curve. The cuff seated like a ring that had always belonged there.

"Seat is clean. Edge is smooth. No shear at the moment."

Live trace steadied; the pale bloom at each pulse eased by a small measure. "Record that change. Begin shallow breath and cough test," Elias instructed.

Maris drew in, breathed out through parted lips, and gave one short cough. The cuff flexed and returned. No gap showed at the seam.

"Border control only," Elias added.

A narrow circle of lichen enzyme went to the cuff edge. The line settled and became a neat margin. "Border set. No wicking beyond the mark," Mira confirmed.

A seed-dot woke just outside the seam and offered a steady number. "Signal is clear. Noise falls a little. Flow at the branch normalizes by a small percentage," Elias read.

"Warmth at the site. Low. Even," Maris reported.

"Scale it, please," Mira prompted.

"Two. No change so far."

Coolant touched the surface for a breath; the pack lifted. "Holding steady. No discoloration. No fluid at the anchors."

A minute of quiet let the trace draw its clean line. Elias allowed the stillness to finish its work, then set the course, "Primary objective achieved. Cuff remains seated. Vessel wall holds shape through pulse and breath. We will monitor for forty eight hours. No additional action today."

Stylus poised, Trusell checked, "Observation schedule."

"Set continuous telemetry. Nurse checks at two hours, six hours, and twelve hours. Full review at twenty four hours and again at forty eight hours. If warmth climbs above four on ten, if tingling radiates, or if the trace drifts beyond the set band, call the team at once."

A clear barrier covered the field and a plain dressing followed. Anchors released with a soft give and left the skin clean. "You did well," Mira told her. "We will move you to observation with Advocate Serano."

Maris exhaled through her nose and gave a small nod, "Thank you."

Serano set a hand near, not on, Maris's arm, "I will sit with you. If you wish to pause at any point, say so and we will pause."

"Scheduling," Trusell prompted from the board.

"Yes. Begin the next set of intakes three days from today," Elias answered. "One volunteer per session. Space each session by three days. Tribunal present for each. Advocate present and recorded. No changes to dose or scope until the forty eight hour review."

"Logged. Three days hence, then every three days," Trusell recorded.

Used tools went sealed; a sample plate slid to a timed assay. "Analysis will run in the background. We will have early curves by evening," Mira noted.

Elias held the bench and glanced once toward Liora's screen without moving his hands, "Thank you, all. Maris goes to observation. We hold the field stable and watch."

Kaela gathered wrappers and carried the tray out in quiet steps. The room kept its steady hum. The cuff on the small vessel flexed with each breath and stayed seated, a simple ring doing a simple job while the ship counted time.

"Evening in the small operations chamber. The door sealed. Paper filters breathed. One recorder light glowed blue."

Commander Aric Veynar sat at the narrow end of the table. Councillor Hollis Venner and Councillor Kaldor Mirea took the left and right. Director Amaris Colvern set her case down and folded her hands. Clerk Evan Trusell stood with his slate.

Veynar reviewed the board and began, "Phase Beta, delivery step, subject Maris Delane. Status is stable. Adhesion holds. Forty eight hour observation is underway."

Colvern folded her hands. "Resources. You have material for five patients this cycle. You have three volunteers."

Veynar kept his tone even, "Correct. We need two more."

Venner glanced to Trusell and tapped the margin. "Read the Charter section for shortfall."

Trusell scrolled and read in a clear voice, "Continuance Rotation, Section Fifteen. When volunteer count fails to meet a scheduled medical trial that carries community value, the ship may draw from households with open medical service obligations under the Venture Bond. The draw is based on a rotation. A household may present a substitute volunteer of equal or closer indication. Minors are barred. Hardship cases may seek relief through the Advocate panel. All selections require Tribunal consent."

Mirea tapped the table once. "We have used this for immunization cycles and forward staffing. We have not used it for first-in-human."

Colvern held her gaze steady. "This is a community trial with the ship's future in view. The bond permits the rotation."

Veynar listened to the air move and chose his words. "We will use the rotation with every guard we have. No performance splice. Delivery and sensing only. Advocate in the room. Tribunal present. Households may send a substitute who meets the indication. We will not harm trust for speed."

Venner gave one short nod. "Name the steps."

Veynar laid them out with a fingertip count, "First, post the notice with exact scope and the calendar. Second, call the households with open obligations, beginning with those who flagged willingness in prior screenings. Third, open the hardship window for a full day. Fourth, seat the Advocate panel to hear relief requests. Fifth, schedule intakes at three day intervals until we reach five."

Colvern opened her case file and checked a line. "Funding ties to measurable progress. I want weekly briefs with signal quality, adhesion rates, and adverse events, even if the numbers move by small degrees."

"You will have them," Veynar replied. "Clerk, mark the schedule. The next intake is three days from today. Then every three days until five are complete."

Trusell nodded once. "Logged. Notices will quote Section Fifteen and list relief steps in plain speech."

A tone touched the door. At Veynar's request, Serano stepped in and took the empty chair.

Veynar gestured to the table's center. "Advocate, we are short two subjects. We will start the Continuance Rotation. We need you to chair hardship review, confirm every consent, and keep the line bright."

"I will," Serano answered. "The process will be clear. People will see the door they can use to step forward, and the door they can use to step back."

Mirea turned a page in her folio. "The crew should hear one human voice as well as policy. Say it from the bridge."

"I will address the ship after this meeting," Veynar agreed.

Trusell's slate chimed. He checked the alert. "A fourth volunteer is at the Advocate window. Name submitted. Mid-stage, fits indication."

Serano verified on a second screen and let out a small, satisfied breath. "I know her. She helped in hydroponics during the last outage. She understands what consent is. I will take her into counsel."

"That fills four," Venner noted. "One remains."

Colvern clicked her case latch shut. "Post the rotation at once. Keep the promise of a narrow scope. Deliver clean data. The budget follows the proof."

"The rotation will run with care," Veynar concluded. "We end the session on that."

Trusell marked the close. The recorder light faded. The door unsealed with a soft release.

Veynar stepped to the shipwide mic outside the chamber and waited for the channel to settle. He used the steady voice the crew recognized. "Ship, this is Commander Veynar. Phase Beta began today with a delivery layer that supports a single vessel at the edge of a Spiral lesion. We will watch for forty eight hours. We need two more subjects to complete this cycle. We will follow the Continuance Rotation under Section Fifteen. Households with open obligations will be called in order. You may send a substitute if that person fits the medical indication. Minors are barred. If your household faces hardship, the Advocate panel will hear you. Consent remains the center. The scope remains delivery and sensing. We do this together and we do it with care."

The channel closed.

In the Wardens' bay, Dax Morlin signed out a low-impact capture kit for a juvenile hammer tail plate core. Straps, nets, and the shock frame took a careful once-over. His thumb pressed the tag. The case settled on the bench.

In the lab, Mira sterilized the loom arms and set the tray for the next intake. Without lifting her eyes, she kept her voice low. "We will have four if the Advocate confirms. The rotation will give us the fifth."

On the monitor, Maris's cuff pulsed with her breath. Elias kept watch. "Schedule holds. We move one patient at a time."

Down the corridor, Kaela saw the notice print onto a wall screen: a clear block of text with dates, contact, and the Advocate's office set in bold. People stopped to read. One took a picture. Another touched the screen and stepped away to think.

At the Advocate desk, Serano met the new volunteer in a quiet room. Two chairs. One table. No hurry.

"Tell me your name," Serano invited, warm and steady.

The woman folded her scarf onto her lap. "I am ready to help. I know what I sign. Please take my name."

Evening light shifted to the ship's softer setting. The Wayfarer bay dimmed to service level. On the monitor, the cuff held its seat. The clock for forty eight hours began to matter. The ledger for the rotation wrote its first line.
