Chapter 04 -- The Sunfan

"Late afternoon on Procurement Deck One, inside the launch bay of the Meridian, where turbines warm the air and the floor hums."

The bay worked like a calm heart. Fans held a low chord under the ribs. Decon sprayers sighed along the seams and left the faint scent of heated stone and clean metal. Two Kestrel skimmers waited nose to nose, low to the deck with their bellies cupped for the nets. A soft cart held the cage, door open, motors quiet and ready.

Captain Draeven walked the chalk circle and let the room's noise settle. "Wardens to me," he said. "Ready check."

"Specialist Hale," Hale said, palm to chest.

"Dax," the pilot said, one hand on Kestrel One's rail.

"Nyra Solwyn on comms," Nyra said from the console by the bay window, heat maps bright on her slate.

"Medical, open the line," Draeven said.

Elias came in clear from the Lattice Suite. "Medical online. Model is armed. Tone Sync ready."

Mira followed on channel two, voice warm and steady. "Decon intake P D three is green. Cage crew will receive on your call."

Draeven stepped to Hale while Dax ran a gentle fan test that lifted his hair and set it back again. Hale knelt by Kestrel Two's outrigger and ran her fingertips over each smart coupler, read the lights, and let touch find what the eyes might miss.

"Report," Draeven said.

"Couplers are clean," Hale said. "Tranquilizer pod is set for low dose. Locks are tight."

Draeven watched her with the patience he kept for weather. Hale stood and tightened the strap on her glove.

"You asked me once why I stayed when Procurement cut stipends," she said. "My mother worked Ridgeworks on the temperate ring. She showed me how to move with weight, not against it. Spiral took her grip early. She kept working and she taught me patience when hands get tired. I joined Wardens because I am good with lines and I keep a calm pull. If the Sunfan helps Medical teach a body to hold, I want my hands in that work."

Draeven gave one small nod. "Then keep the pull even and keep your hands."

Nyra lifted a small training speaker on a cart. One green light winked. "Tone up," she said.

A low note warmed the air, climbed half a step, and settled like a palm between shoulder blades.

Elias spoke above it. "When a Sunfan heats, its plates open like a fan and it sweeps in a single smooth line. Follow that move. Tone Lock will tell you when you are lined up and can throw. Smooth pursuit keeps the couplers latched."

"Kestrel One copies," Dax said. "Tone Sync is green."

"Kestrel Two copies," Hale said. "Mirror ready."

Draeven clipped his helmet. "We bring one body home alive. We do our work and we return. Helm, open the gate."

The bay doors unsealed with a breath that tasted of warm dust. The tone dimmed under the rise of the engines. Skimmer fans wound up with the patience of machines that knew they lived in a garden as well as a hunt.

"Deck One to V R two gate," Draeven said. "Roll."

The Kestrels slid from their cradles and took a low glide across the bay. Decon sprayers drew a white curtain that smelled faintly of lemon and then parted. Warmth folded around them as they crossed the threshold.

"Moments later inside the V R two arid ring, where heat moves like wind and stone sings under the skids."

The artificial sky sat close and bright. Heat shimmer walked the air in thin veils that made far edges quiver. The ground sang a soft iron note under the fans. Basalt ridges rose ahead like dark walls. Between them, dune backs showed pale just under a brittle crust. Somewhere out of sight, a vent let out a long breath that smelled of warmed dust and old shell.

"Kestrel One, set the pace," Draeven said. "Kestrel Two, hold the mirror."

"Copy," Dax said. "Glide height one meter. Speed twenty."

"Mirror set," Hale said. She took her place a short length off Dax's port side and let the skimmer's small motions teach her grip. She watched the world in slices. Ridge face. Dust lift. Shadow. Light. She set a four count in her chest, the quiet measure her mother had taught her when tools were heavier than hands.

Nyra's voice turned the slate into ground truth. "Heat band strengthens near Sector fourteen ridges," she said. "Expect mirage shimmer. Listen for plate rattle."

At first the sound was more idea than noise, a dry clatter that came and went like seed pods shaken by a lazy wind. Then it settled into the ear and made sense.

"Mark," Draeven said.

"Right side," Hale said. "I hear it."

Elias raised the tone in their helmets a small degree. "Tone rising with the model's heat," he said. "Overlay is live. Hold for my call."

"Kestrel One ready for Tone Lock," Dax said. He rode the bars with loose elbows and an easy jaw, the posture of a pilot who respected machines and expected them to answer in kind.

Hale matched his calm. She glanced once at the coupler lights to acknowledge the rig and confirm the readout. Each outboard arm showed green. The pod under her right hand waited like a promise.

Nyra traced a clean line on her slate. "Shimmer at two o clock on the ridge face," she said. "Distance thirty meters. Pattern matches Sunfan movement."

Draeven placed his voice where it would help. "Let the tone set the move," he said.

Dax breathed once for steadiness. "Holding."

Elias lifted the tone a breath nearer, and a path arrived in the body the way a remembered song finds the mouth. "In five heartbeats," he said. "Four. Three. Two. One. Now."

Kestrel One eased into a long, quiet sweep. Kestrel Two matched and settled. The fans sang a single chord. Dust lifted in pulses along the slope, as if the ground were practicing breath.

"Tone Lock," Dax said. "Holding."

"Tone Lock," Hale said. "Hands are steady."

Nyra's voice sharpened. "Eyes on Sunfan," she said. "Plates open and bright. The move is smooth and constant. Distance twenty."

The rattle deepened. Light wavered at the edges of the plates as they found one another and kept their shape. Inside the mirage, a body took ownership of its own motion.

Elias kept his words level and few. "Stay smooth. Even pull. The tone will carry your hands."

Hale did not check the lights. She watched the line where dust lifted from rock, and she let the four count keep her wrists quiet. When she had been small, her mother had shown her with a rope and a crate how a steady draw did more than a hard tug. Work with what you have. Keep the breath honest. Let steadiness win.

A scratch of static touched the channel. The tone fluttered, then corrected.

"Filter set," Nyra said. "Channel clear."

"If you feel the wobble, breathe once and let the tone bring you back," Elias said.

"Back on line," Dax said.

Above them, the shimmer shifted. A second heat signature bloomed higher on the ridge, broader by the look of it, a crown that watched their work.

"Second heat signature," Nyra said. "Ridge crown. Larger by one third. Distance thirty."

Draeven kept the team inside one assignment. "We secure one body," he said. "Kestrel One, stand by for Net One on my word. Kestrel Two, keep the mirror and keep your pull even."

"Copy," Dax said.

"Copy," Hale said.

The lower Sunfan moved again along the same smooth line, plates clicking in quick, dry notes that felt like decision. The cage crew rolled from behind a basalt spur, hands on guide bars, steps matched. The door stood open like a promise that wanted to close.

Elias lifted the tone a breath to mark timing. "You are near the call," he said. "Hands easy. Let the tone do its work."

Hale adjusted one finger width and felt the skimmer answer with quiet trust. The couplers hummed on their arms, a balance she had learned to sense through her palms.

"On my word," Draeven said, eyes on spacing.

Hale drew a breath and let it fall away. Heat tasted faintly of iron. The rattle found a second voice, lower and patient, as if the body was both opening and listening.

"Now," Elias said.

Dax eased his thumb and the net left the cradle in a soft rush. It opened like a sail and moved with the air rather than against it. The couplers reached for their marks with small clicks that sounded more like decisions than hardware.

"I have one," Dax said. "Two is looking. Three is hunting."

Hale watched her indicators without staring them down. "I can give you room," she said. "I will hold the mirror."

The Sunfan swept along its smooth line, plates bright at the edges where heat pressed through. Dust lifted in pulses from the slope and came back like breath. A low rattle threaded the air, steady and patient, and then broke in a small run that sounded like nerves.

"Let it talk," Draeven said. "We do not pull. We guide."

"Three has it," Dax said. "Four is shy."

The fourth coupler skated along a plate seam and failed to catch. The net bellied for a heartbeat and set a small, wrong tug into the line.

"Do not snatch," Elias said. "Ease your hands. Give a finger of slack and take it back slow."

Dax shifted his grip and felt the Kestrel answer like a well taught animal. The wrong tug softened and the belly came out of the net. The fourth coupler kissed metal and clicked.

"Four," Dax said. "We are set."

"Net Two," Draeven said.

"On my count," Hale said. "Three. Two. Now."

Her net went with a gentle thump and opened cleanly. The outer couplers looked for the places that would share the strain without biting. Hale kept her wrists quiet and let the rig read the air. One coupler found a lip, then the second found a notch. The third slipped, thought better, and came back for a second try.

"Two set," Hale said. "Three is thinking. Four is ready."

Above them, the crown heat shifted its weight. Dust rippled down the ridge in a thin sheet. The rattle changed pitch and made a sound that felt like a warning.

"Eyes on your work," Draeven said. "Chase two rabbits, catch none."

Hale used a light thumb to settle the bar and felt the skimmer relax into her hands. The third coupler found its purchase and held. The fourth was waiting to follow. For a breath the world asked her to choose between speed and steady.

"Let the tone do it," Elias said, almost under his breath.

Hale did not move. The indicator blinked green.

"Four," she said. "We have a wrap."

Draeven let out the smallest breath a person could let out and still call it breath. "Dose low," he said.

"On three," Hale said. "Two. One."

The pod sent a quiet tap through the line. The body inside the net answered with a long exhale, not a drop. The plates stayed open, then softened a touch as if they had been given permission to rest.

"Kestrel One, tension check," Draeven said.

"Even across the line," Dax said. "We are with you."

"Kestrel Two, same," Hale said. "Even and quiet."

Nyra's voice came quick and clear. "Crown heat is moving along the ridge," she said. "Angle suggests it will cross behind you. Distance twenty and closing."

The air felt smaller for a moment, and then it felt ordinary again. The tone in the helmets held the room together.

"Cage to ridge," Draeven said. "We take the door. Slow is kind."

The cage crew pushed the cart along the base of the spur. The door waited, padded and dim inside, a small promise of shade. A tech called distances in a careful voice that had shepherded heavy things through tight places for years.

"Five," the tech said. "Four. Three."

Dax saw a stub of rock where the lip of the cage track met the natural floor. He put his weight on his heels and brought the Kestrel up a hand span to keep his line off the edge. The net rose with him and the couplers kept their calm.

"Thanks," the cart tech said, not for show and not for the record, just because it mattered to say it.

Hale kept her skimmer steady and let the lines settle into their new angles. The Sunfan gave another small exhale. The plates brightened at the edges, then dimmed, like a fire that had been told there was no more reason to perform.

"Two," the tech said. "One. Hold."

"Bring the door," Draeven said.

The cage mouth eased forward until it was the world. The netted body entered shadow and made a small, careful sound that might have been nothing more than heat leaving metal.

"Tone stays until the latch," Elias said. "Do not cut it early."

Hale nodded even though he could not see her. "Understood."

The cart tech set a hand on the door and pushed. The hinges answered like a well coached team. The padded lips met with the soft patience of things built to be kind.

"Latch," the tech said.

"Latch confirmed," Nyra said from the slate, as if she had watched the line drawing close on a map and loved it.

"Tone down," Elias said. The sound faded in the helmets to a ghost and then to silence.

For a moment no one spoke. The skimmers hovered a little above the floor. The dust settled as if it too had decided that quiet was the right answer.

"Good work," Draeven said. "Bring it to Decon P D three."

"Copy," Dax said.

"Copy," Hale said.

The cart motors hummed and the crew turned for the gate. The skimmers took a low escort on either side. The ridge behind them gave a small, late rattle as if to remark on the event and then lost interest. The larger heat signature, whatever it was in size or intent, moved away along the crown and did not cross their path.

"Public channel," Nyra said softly. "Notice to habitat services. Short transport along the basin path. Dust control will be light. Thank you."

They rolled past a vent that breathed warmth into the air and carried the scent of old shell. The artificial sky made a shallow dome above them, pale and wide. In the helmets there was only the small sound of people being quiet together when a hard thing had gone the way it should.

At the gate, Decon took back the room. Sprayers drew a white curtain. The cart rolled through first. The skimmers waited while the mist did its work. It smelled like lemon and clean metal, and for a brief, sharp second like the iris soap Hale's mother had kept by their basin.

"Deck One receiving," Mira said. "I have the cage on the board. Bring me your escort when you are cleared."

"Cleared," Draeven said. "Escorts inbound."

Fans softened to a patient idle as they entered the bay. The floor hum came back underfoot like an old friend. The cage settled in its cradle and set its weight with a low, pleasing note that made the cart tech smile without meaning to.

Mira met them in a sealed hood and calm hands. "Vitals are reading," she said. "Plate temperature is falling. Respiration is slow and even. The dose did what it was asked to do."

Draeven gave her the shape of a nod he reserved for people who made the next part possible. "Your room," he said.

"P D three intake first," Mira said. "Then holding, then a short walk to the glass. Elias can look at the pattern in an hour, not before."

"Copy," Elias said, and the one word carried patience because it carried respect for the order of things.

Hale powered down her skimmer and felt the life run out of the rails into the floor. She flexed her fingers and let the blood return. Dax took his helmet off and wiped his forehead with the back of one wrist. The sweat tasted the same as it had before the door closed, but it felt earned now, and there was pleasure in that.

Draeven came to stand by Hale's outrigger. "You kept your pull even," he said. "That is what we pay for."

Hale allowed herself a small smile. "That is what my mother taught," she said. "I just do not get in the way of it."

Nyra stepped closer with her slate and turned it so the heat band map faced them both. "The crown signature did not cross you," she said. "It made a wide pass and settled two sectors over. We can talk about that later."

"We will," Draeven said. "Not today."

Across the bay, the cage door faced a window with privacy film. Behind it, a light lifted and fell as if someone were breathing very quietly. Later, Mira would explain it was simply the cooling pads settling into their rhythm. It was not a soul or a sleep, just a pattern waiting to be understood.

"Medical," Draeven said. "You have a living Sunfan inbound to glass in one hour."

"I hear you," Elias said. "Keep the transport steady. Do not hurry the handoff."

Mira's voice came in from close by. "I will take it slow," she said. "The room is ready."

A small group of maintenance workers paused at the far end of the bay to let the cart pass. One of them lifted two fingers in a salute that was not official and not required. Hale returned it with two fingers of her own. She did not look for the crown heat on the slate. She did not look at the clock. She looked at her hands, turned them over once, and let them rest.

"Later that hour in the Lattice Suite, where glass holds light and machines think with quiet sounds."

Elias stood at the console with the room dimmed to a soft gray. Behind the safety glass, the shape inside the cage made a single, slow breath that lifted a plate and set it down again. The cooling pads pulsed with the patience of tide. Mira checked seals and spoke low to the tech behind the second door. Nyra leaned in at the threshold and stayed out of the line of work.

"Play the training tone at whisper," Elias said. "I want to see if the edge of the plates hears it."

Mira set a fingertip on the control and brought the note up just enough to rest on the skin. The sound did not fill the room. It sat where it had been placed and asked nothing.

A faint light along the plate's hinge brightened for a moment and faded. It was not confirmation, nor was it a victory. It was simply a greeting.

Mira saw it too. "I have it," she said. "Mark one small response at the root."

Nyra lifted her slate and captured the moment. "We will need time," she said. "But that looked like listening."

Elias let out a breath he had been holding since the gate. "It looked like that to me as well."

He did not say what the moment meant. He did not ask for more than the room could give. He set the tone back to silence and watched the plate settle. He thought of a boy's name and let the memory stand without burning.

Outside, the bay went back to its rhythm. Fans held a calm chord. The floor hummed. Somewhere in the commons, a tram bell sounded its two clean notes. Somewhere near the plant wall, two paper flowers waited on a bench slat, in a light that smelled faintly of water and leaves.
