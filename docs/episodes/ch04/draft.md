Chapter 04 -- The Sunfan

"Late afternoon on Procurement Deck One, inside the launch bay of the Meridian, where turbines warm the air and the floor hums."

The bay worked like a calm heart. Fans held a low chord under the ribs. Decon sprayers sighed along the seams and left the faint scent of heated stone and clean metal. Two Kestrel skimmers waited nose to nose, low to the deck with their bellies cupped for the nets. A soft cart held the cage, door open, motors quiet and ready.

Captain Draeven walked the chalk circle and let the room's noise settle. "Wardens to me. Ready check."

"Specialist Hale." Palm to chest.

"Dax." One hand on Kestrel One's rail.

"Nyra Solwyn on comms." From the console by the bay window, heat maps bright on her slate.

"Medical, open the line." Draeven said.

Elias came in clear from the Lattice Suite. "Medical online. Model is armed. Tone Sync ready."

Mira followed on channel two, warm and steady. "Decon intake P D three is green. Cage crew will receive on your call."

Draeven stepped to Hale while Dax ran a gentle fan test that lifted his hair and set it back again. Hale knelt by Kestrel Two's outrigger, fingertips passing each smart coupler, reading lights, letting touch find what eyes might miss.

"Report." Draeven said.

"Couplers are clean. Tranquilizer pod set for low dose. Locks are tight."

He watched her with the patience he kept for weather. Hale stood and tightened the strap on her glove.

"You asked me once why I stayed when Procurement cut stipends." she said. "My mother worked Ridgeworks on the temperate ring. She taught me to move with weight, not against it. Spiral took her grip early. She kept working and taught me patience when hands get tired. I joined the Wardens because I am good with lines and I can keep a calm pull. If the Sunfan helps Medical teach a body to hold together, I want my hands in that work."

Draeven gave one small nod. "Then keep the pull even and keep your hands steady."

Nyra set a small training speaker on a cart. One green light winked. "Tone up."

A low note warmed the air, climbed half a step, and settled like a palm between the shoulder blades.

Elias spoke above it. "When a Sunfan heats, its armor plates open like a fan and it sweeps in one smooth line. Follow that move. Tone Lock will tell you when you are lined up and can throw. Smooth pursuit keeps the couplers latched."

"Kestrel One copies." Dax rolled one shoulder loose on the bars, jaw easy. "Tone Sync green."

"Kestrel Two copies." Hale's grip stayed soft, her four count steady against her ribs. "Mirror ready."

Draeven clipped his helmet. "We bring one home alive, Doctor. We do our work and we return home, team. Helm, open the gate."

The bay doors unsealed with a breath that tasted of warm dust. The tone dimmed under the rise of the engines. Skimmer fans wound up with the patience of machines that knew they lived in a garden as well as a hunt.

"Deck One to V R two gate." Draeven said. "Let us roll."

The Kestrels slid from their cradles and took a low glide across the bay. Decon sprayers drew a white curtain that smelled faintly of lemon, then parted. Warmth folded around them as they crossed the threshold.

Moments later inside the V R two arid ring, where heat moved on the wind and stone screeched beneath the skids.

The artificial sky sat close and bright. Heat shimmer walked the air in thin veils that made far edges quiver. The ground sang a soft iron note under the fans. Basalt ridges rose ahead like dark walls. Between them, dune backs showed pale beneath a brittle crust. Somewhere out of sight, a vent let out a long breath that smelled of warmed dust and old shell.

"Kestrel One, set the pace. Kestrel Two, hold the mirror."

"Copy." Dax lifted his gaze to the seam line and let his elbows float. "Glide height one meter. Speed twenty."

"Mirror set." Hale slid into position off his port side and let the skimmer's small motions teach her grip. She watched the world in slices. Ridge face. Dust lift. Shadow. Light. Her four count kept the wrists quiet, the measure her mother taught when tools were heavier than hands.

Nyra's voice turned the slate into ground truth. "Heat band strengthens near Sector fourteen ridges. Expect a mirage-like shimmer. Listen for the Sunfan plates to rattle as they expand."

At first the sound was more idea than noise, a dry clatter like seed pods in a lazy wind. Then it settled into the ear and made sense.

"Mark." Draeven said.

"Right side." Hale shifted a breath through her teeth. "I hear it."

Elias raised the tone in their helmets a small degree. "Capture tone is rising with the model's heat. Overlay is live. Hold for my call."

"Kestrel One ready for Tone Lock." Dax let the bars breathe under his palms, posture loose, respect in the hands.

Hale matched his calm. She flicked a glance across the coupler lights to confirm the readout. Each outboard arm showed green. The pod beneath her right hand was a firm reassurance.

Nyra traced a clean line on her slate. "Shimmer at two o clock on the ridge face. Distance thirty meters. Pattern matches Sunfan movement."

Draeven placed his voice where it would help. "Let the tone set the move."

"Holding." Dax eased a slow breath and settled the nose.

Elias lifted the tone a breath nearer, and a path arrived in the body the way a remembered song finds the mouth. "In five heartbeats. Four. Three. Two. One. Now."

Kestrel One eased into a long, quiet sweep. Kestrel Two matched and settled. The engine fans sang a single chord. Dust lifted in pulses along the slope, as if the ground were practicing breath.

"Tone Lock." Dax kept his elbows light. "Holding."

"Tone Lock." Hale checked the mirror line without lingering. "Hands steady."

Nyra's voice sharpened. "Eyes on Sunfan. Plates open and bright. The move is smooth and constant. Distance twenty."

The rattle deepened. Light wavered at the plate edges as they found one another and held. Inside the mirage, a body took ownership of its motion.

Elias kept his words level and few. "Stay smooth. Even pull. The tone will notify your hands."

Hale did not check the lights. She watched the line where dust lifted from rock and let the four count keep her wrists quiet. When she was small, her mother showed her with a rope and a crate how a steady draw did more than a hard tug. Work with what you have. Keep the breath honest. Let steadiness win.

A scratch of static touched the channel. The tone fluttered, then corrected.

"Filter set." Nyra thumbed the gain and watched the haze clean. "Channel clear."

"If you feel the wobble, breathe once and let the tone bring your timing back." Elias said.

"Back on the line." Dax eased a breath through his teeth and let the bars settle into the groove.

Above them, the shimmer shifted. A second heat signature bloomed higher on the ridge, broader by the look of it, a crown that watched their work.

"Second heat signature." Nyra's slate glowed warm. "Ridge crown. Larger by one third. Distance thirty."

Draeven kept the team inside one assignment. "We secure one body. Kestrel One, stand by for net one on my word. Kestrel Two, keep the mirror and keep your pull even."

"Copy." Dax rolled one shoulder loose, jaw easy, eyes steady on the seam.

"Copy." Hale's grip stayed soft; her four count tapped calm against her ribs.

The lower Sunfan moved again along the same smooth line, plates clicking in quick, dry notes that held no hint of agitation. It skimmed ahead with measured urgency, aware of what followed yet unruffled, its path unwavering and calm. The cage crew rolled out from behind a basalt spur, hands steady on the guide bars, steps in quiet sync. The open door waited, plain and expectant.

Elias lifted the tone a breath to mark timing. "You are near the call. Hands easy. Let the tone do its work."

Hale opened a finger's width. The skimmer answered with quiet trust. Couplers hummed along the arms, balance she could feel through her palms.

"On my word." Draeven watched the spacing.

Hale drew a breath and let it fall away. Heat tasted faintly of iron. The rattle found a second voice, lower and patient, as if the body were both opening and listening.

"Now." Elias said.

Dax eased his thumb and the net left the cradle in a soft rush. It opened like a sail and moved with the air rather than against it. The couplers reached for their marks with small clicks that sounded more like decisions than hardware.

"Coupler one is locked." Dax's gaze tracked the spread. "Two is searching. Three is closing."

"I can give you room." Hale let a hair of slack through the mirror line. "Holding the mirror."

The Sunfan swept along its smooth path, plate edges bright where heat pressed through. Dust lifted in pulses from the slope and returned like breath. A low rattle threaded the air, steady and patient, then broke in a brief run that sounded like nerves.

"Let it lead." Draeven ordered. "We do not pull. We guide."

"Three has it." Dax narrowed on the seam. "Four is just shy."

The fourth coupler skated along a plate seam and failed to catch. The net bellied for a heartbeat and set a small, wrong tug into the line.

"Do not snatch." Elias warned, quick but even. "Ease your hands. Give a finger of slack and take it back slow."

Dax shifted his grip. The Kestrel answered like a well taught animal. The wrong tug softened; the belly came out of the net. The fourth coupler kissed metal and clicked.

"Four locked." Relief touched his mouth, not his hands. "We are set."

"Net two." Draeven said.

"On my count." Hale's breath marked the seconds. "Three. Two. Now."

Her net went with a gentle thump and opened cleanly. The outer couplers looked for the places that would share the strain without biting. Hale kept her wrists quiet and let the rig read the air. One coupler found a lip, then the second found a notch. The third slipped, thought better, and came back for a second try.

"Two set." Hale said. "Three is thinking. Four is ready."

Above them, the crown heat shifted its weight. Dust rippled down the ridge in a thin sheet. The rattle changed pitch and made a sound that felt like a warning.

Eyes on your work." Draeven said. "Chase two rabbits and you will catch none."

Hale let a light thumb settle the bar and felt the skimmer relax into her hands. The third coupler bit and held. The fourth hovered, waiting for timing. For a breath the world asked her to choose between speed and steady.

"Let the tone do it." Elias murmured.

She kept still. The indicator clicked to green.

"Four." she said. "We have a wrap."

Draeven let out the smallest breath a person could let out and still call it breath. "Dose low."

"On three. Two. One."

The pod gave a quiet tap through the line. Inside the net, the body answered with a long exhale, not a drop. Plates stayed open, then softened, as if given permission to rest.

"Kestrel One, tension check."

"Even across the line." Dax glanced the spread and kept his cadence. "We are with you."

"Kestrel Two, same."

"Even and quiet." Hale said. The mirror read true.

"Crown heat is moving along the ridge." Nyra reported, quick and clear. "Angle suggests a cross behind you. Distance twenty and closing."

The air pinched small, then went ordinary again. The tone in their helmets held the room together.

"Cage to ridge." Draeven said. "We take the door. Slow is fast. Remember that."

The cage crew pushed along the base of the spur. The door waited, padded and dim inside, a small promise of shade. A tech called distances in a careful voice that had shepherded heavy things through tight places for years.

"Five. Four. Three."

Dax caught a stub of rock where the track lip met natural floor. He set back on his heels and lifted the Kestrel a hand span to clear it. The net rose with him; the couplers kept their lock.

"Thanks." the cart tech said---no show, no record, just because it mattered.

Hale held the skimmer steady and let the lines take new angles. The Sunfan breathed again. Plate rims brightened, then dimmed, like a fire told there was no more reason to perform.

"Two. One. Hold."

"Bring the door." Draeven said.

The cage mouth eased forward until it was the world. The netted body entered shadow and made a small, careful sound, maybe only heat leaving metal.

"Tone stays until the latch." Elias said. "Do not cut early."

"Understood." Hale replied, knowing he could not see the nod.

The cart tech set a palm to the door and pushed. The hinges answered like a well-coached team. Padded lips met with the soft patience of things built to be kind.

"Latch."

"Latch confirmed." Nyra said from the slate, like watching a line close on a map you love.

"Tone down." Elias said. The sound faded to a ghost, then to silence.

For a moment no one spoke. Skimmers hovered a little above the floor. Dust settled, as if it too had decided that quiet was the right answer.

"Good work." Draeven said. "Bring it to Decon P D three."

Dax took the praise and answered at once. "Copy."

Hale let the steadiness in her hands speak first. "Copy."

The cart motors hummed as the crew turned for the gate. The skimmers took a low escort on either side. The ridge behind them gave a small, late rattle---as if to remark on the event---and then lost interest. The larger heat signature, whatever its size or intent, moved along the crown and did not cross their path.

"Public channel." Nyra said softly. "Notice to habitat services: short transport along the basin path. Dust control will be light. Thank you."

They rolled past a vent that breathed warmth into the air and carried the scent of old shell. The artificial sky made a shallow dome above them, pale and wide. In their helmets was only the small sound of people being quiet together after a hard thing had gone the way it should.

At the gate, Decon took back the room. Sprayers drew a white curtain. The cart rolled through first. The skimmers waited while the mist did its work. It smelled like lemon and clean metal, and for a brief, sharp instant like the iris soap Hale's mother had kept by their basin.

"Deck One receiving." Mira said. "I have the cage on the board. Bring me your escort when you are cleared."

"Cleared." Draeven's tone carried the certainty of habit. "Escorts inbound."

The engine fans softened to a patient idle as they entered the bay. The floor hum returned underfoot like an old friend. The cage settled in its cradle with a low, pleasing note that made the cart tech smile without meaning to.

Mira met them in a sealed hood, hands calm. "Vitals are reading. Plate temperature is falling. Respiration is slow and even. The dose is keeping it perfectly calm."

Draeven gave her the nod he reserved for people who made the next part possible. "It is your room now."

"P D three intake first. Then holding, then a short walk to the glass. Elias, you can look at the pattern in an hour, not before."

"Copy that." Elias's voice carried patience, because it carried respect for the order of things.

Hale powered down her skimmer and felt the life drain from the rails into the floor. She flexed her fingers and let the blood return. Dax pulled off his helmet and wiped his forehead with the back of one wrist. The sweat tasted the same as before the door closed, but it felt earned now, and there was pleasure in that.

Draeven came to stand by Hale's outrigger. "You kept your pull even. That is what we pay for."

She allowed herself a small smile. "That is what my mother taught. I just do not get in the way of it."

Nyra stepped closer, slate angled so the heat band map faced them both. "The crown signature did not cross you. It made a wide pass and settled two sectors over. We can talk about that later."

"We will. Not today."

Across the bay, the cage door faced a window veiled with privacy film. Behind it, a light lifted and fell like a quiet breath. Later, Mira would say the cooling pads were settling into rhythm, a pattern to study.

"Medical." Draeven called. "You have a living Sunfan inbound to glass in one hour."

"I hear you." Elias replied. "Keep the transport steady. Do not hurry the handoff."

"I will take it slow." Mira said. "The room is ready."

At the far end of the bay, a small group of maintenance workers paused to let the cart pass. One lifted two fingers in a salute that was not official and not required. Hale returned it with two fingers of her own. She did not look for the crown heat on the slate. She did not look at the clock. She looked at her hands, turned them over once, and let them rest.

Later that hour in the Lattice Suite, where glass held light and machines thought in quiet sounds.

Elias stood at the console, the room dimmed to soft gray. Behind the safety glass, the shape inside the cage drew a slow breath that lifted a plate and set it down again. Cooling pads pulsed with the patience of tide. Mira checked seals and spoke low to the tech behind the second door. Nyra leaned at the threshold and stayed out of the line of work.

"Play the training tone at whisper." Elias said. "I want to see if the plate edges respond."

Mira set a fingertip on the control and brought the note up just enough to rest on the skin. The sound did not fill the room. It sat where it had been placed and asked nothing.

A faint light at the hinge brightened, then faded. The moment stood as a first sign.

"I have it." Mira said. "Mark one small response at the root."

Nyra lifted her slate and captured it. "We will need time. But that looked like listening."

Elias let out a breath he had been holding since the gate. "It looked like that to me as well."

He did not say what it meant. He did not ask for more than the room could give. He set the tone back to silence and watched the plate settle. He thought of a boy's name and let the memory stand without burning.

Outside, the bay returned to its rhythm. Fans held a calm chord. The floor hummed. Somewhere in the commons, a tram bell sounded its two clean notes. Somewhere near the plant wall, two paper flowers waited on a bench slat, in a light that smelled faintly of water and leaves.
