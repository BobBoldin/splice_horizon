Chapter 48 --- The Thirst Ledger

The alert reached Command with a clean tone that never got used for drama. Director Veynar looked once at the screen, then called the room the way a foreman calls a line meeting after a blade chips. Commander Colvern arrived with her folder and a short stack of clean pages. Rane crossed from Wardens with a log slate and a steady face. Elias stepped in from medical with cuffs still around his neck from a morning round. Environmental brought their chief, Patel, and her lead mechanic, Muniz, both with hands that carried scrubber dust deep in the lines.

Colvern opened. "Inventory confirms the theft," she reported. "The rack that disappeared with the freighter carried two full sets of water media: ion-exchange resins, catalytic cartridges, membrane cassettes, and the bio-reactor starters we planned to seed next quarter. This room treats it as life-critical."

Patel laid a laminated schematic on the table with the same care people use for newborns and old rifles. "Meridian drinks one gallon per person per day once you count food prep and hygiene," she began, voice plain. "Men trend near three point seven liters, women near two point seven. Our recovery loop keeps that sane: we pull water from urine, sweat, breath, and washdown, then polish it through beds and membranes. We maintain a ninety-six to ninety-eight percent water recovery rate on good weeks. That keeps daily makeup around two hundred to seven hundred gallons. Our store tanks like that number."

She tapped the diagram where the cassettes should sit. "Without those beds and cassettes in rotation, recovery falls. I can hold eighty-five percent by cannibalizing the old train and turning buffers into polishers, yet that pushes daily makeup toward fifteen hundred gallons. If recovery slips to eighty, we push two thousand gallons. We do not ship in that volume. We plan or we thirst."

Veynar printed numbers on his pad while he listened. "Storage?"

"Eighty thousand gallons in total tanks," Patel answered, "with five thousand earmarked for firefighting foam and ten thousand locked for thermal balance we cannot touch. At eighty-five percent recovery, we burn thirty-five thousand gallons in twenty-three days with current headcount and current habits. At eighty percent, we cut that to sixteen days. We can stretch with rationing. Stretch does not equal comfort."

Colvern met the room's eyes one by one. "We run two tracks," she set. "Operations builds stopgaps. Wardens chase the stolen rack. We brief the Captain with schedules, not hopes."

Muniz leaned over the schematic and traced the polishing loop. "I can repack one train from spares and scrap," he offered. "Zeolite from air scrubber cartridges, activated carbon from stock, silver media from the old potable guards. We reload housings and cycle slow. Efficiency will read low and pressure drop will read high. We can make ugly water drinkable if we give it time."

Elias rubbed a thumb along his jaw while he mapped failure modes in his head. "We add a bio leg," he suggested, tone careful. "Hydroponics can donate root mats to seed a small bioreactor. We run heat-sterilized gravel and netting as a substrate and let microbes take the first pass on organics. We follow with your repacked polishers. We cut chlorine shock to a whisper to keep the colony healthy. Medical will monitor for pathogens with a daily panel. Risk lives in biofouling and lag time. Reward lives in keeping the chemical beds from drowning under load."

Patel weighed it, then nodded. "We can build three small bio towers in a day if Engineering lets us steal two coil stacks and a pair of spare circulators. We place them near Hydro so root trims stay fresh. We meter flow like a miser."

Veynar drew a second column. "Distillation?"

Muniz pointed to the waste-heat map. "We throw vapor-compression stills together with refinery coil, two compressors, and a repurposed brewery chiller," he answered. "Waste heat from the reactor jacket drives the first lift. Compressors give us the phase change without burning extra fuel. Yield reads modest and steady. Think two hundred gallons per day per still once we tune the stacks. We can stage three units in a week if Procurement turns its keys and nobody cries over the brewery."

"That brewery gives us morale," Rane observed, dry. "We drink water first. We drink beer at the wedding."

Hale, who had drifted to the doorway when she heard the call, lifted two fingers in half-salute, half-promise. "We pour at the reception," she quipped, then grew serious. "We help move parts."

Colvern drew the ration ladder on a clean page. "Phase One," she outlined. "Hygiene rotation moves to two-day cycles, then three if the panel wants. Laundry shifts to industrial only with cloth allotments per deck. Food prep receives priority water for sanitation over variety. Hydroponics reduces misting by ten percent and raises airflow to encourage leaf drying. Medical posts hand-wash stations at key corridors with measured taps."

"Fire reserve remains sacred," Patel added, firm. "We prove nothing by burning through our own safety boundary."

"We keep the boundary," Colvern affirmed. "We also assign spot teams to chase silent losses: weeps at fittings, bad seals at galley sprayers, old valves that bleed into drains. Every gallon that escapes now writes a name."

Rane flipped her slate to a new page. "Wardens will run a sweep," she committed. "We start with known barter corners for contraband water. We walk the galleries and storerooms where private stills would hide. We shut down unlogged wash stations and we tag every hose clamp that bites into memory. We greet people with a calm face and a clear reason. We post the numbers. People respect numbers."

Veynar put a box around "pursuit." "We track the stolen media through Cold Mother's chain," he set. "Rook's traffic pulls gave us a lane. Maud's crew ran clean. The dock between the rocks reads like a quiet shoulder. We run drones there and we listen. We hold names, then we act."

Colvern turned to Elias. "Your panel?"

"I expand the water panel for illness flags," Elias returned. "Dehydration markers rise first in children and elders. We post simple signs: urine color chart, dizziness notes, heat stress cues. Nurses run walkabouts at shift change and talk about salt and smart mouth feel. We bring people to the medical bay early rather than late. We add oral rehydration mix to every galley line with a clear scoop size."

Patel drew her finger along the ISS numbers printed on the bottom of her sheet. "We keep the crew honest with facts," she urged. "We name the math. A closed loop can reclaim ninety-three to ninety-eight percent of onboard water through urine, sweat, breath, and washdown. Our loop held ninety-six. The theft pulls us down. Without any recycling, this ship would require hundreds of thousands of gallons per month. Our tanks cannot cover that. Our loop will carry us if we prop it up and cut habits that leak."

Veynar nodded. "We will put the numbers in the Captain's mouth," he agreed. "People carry hard rules when leaders carry hard math."

Colvern set the timing. "Twelve hours to Phase One," she ordered. "Engineering builds the first bio tower by night. Muniz drafts the still parts list before he eats. Procurement opens the cage and logs out the copper. Wardens brief on ration enforcement as support, not punishment. Elias writes the handout in words that fit a lunch line. Patel logs the plant reconfiguration and posts meters to the main board."

Patel looked across the table at Muniz. "We pull carbon from the spare scrubber frames," she stated. "We cut the frames in half, wash the pellets in hot distillate, and reload the housings. We mix new resin with old to stabilize the shoulder of the curve. We run high-pressure flushes on the old membranes to buy back a percent or two while we wait on the towers."

Muniz's eyes warmed with the pleasure of a technical problem that matters. "We feed the flush water to the first still," he answered. "We keep the heat busy."

Elias lifted a hand. "Bio towers need gentle starts," he cautioned. "We feed them a lean broth, then thicken as colonies stabilize. Hydroponics can spare nutrient flush. We keep chlorine shock out of their day. We use ultraviolet at the last panel to close the loop."

"Logged," Patel acknowledged. "We tweak the dosing pumps and move the UV from the old graywater line."

Rane wrote names down the side of her slate. "Hale," she called through the door, "build a quick team for seals and clamps. Dax, pull two from your crew to haul copper and stand the towers. Joren, you're with me on the barter corners and the machine shops. We talk to people with respect and we bring tools in case respect needs help."

"Understood," Hale returned, already moving. Dax touched his temple once and disappeared toward Range Two. Joren stepped through the door with Kaela at his shoulder and a pack slung by habit, legs steady under the new anchors.

Kaela caught Elias's eye. "I will tap Hydro for root mats and spare netting," she offered. "We have a tray we planned to compost. The roots carry a solid biofilm that reads healthy under a microscope."

"Good," Elias replied. "Bring them wet. We seat them before they dry."

Colvern straightened her pages and looked at Veynar. "We deliver a shipwide address in thirty minutes," she decided. "You lead with numbers. I follow with work assignments. Elias reads health cues. Patel explains what people can do at a sink that matters. Rane tells them where Wardens stand when habits pick fights with survival."

Veynar lifted his pencil and balanced it across two fingers. "I keep it short," he promised. "People hear truth when truth fits inside breath."

They broke the room the way crews break a job site when the cement truck arrives: fast, focused, and with an understanding that every minute counts once you uncork a plan. Muniz jogged for the cage keys. Patel grabbed markers and a tape to relabel valves without confusion. Rane moved with intent and a list. Elias stopped in his office long enough to print the color chart and a one-page handout titled "The Thirst Ledger: How We Keep the Ship Drinking."

The address filled the ship with steady voices and clean directives. Veynar walked through the math in simple terms. "Each person needs about one gallon per day to drink, cook, and keep clean enough to stay healthy," he explained. "Our loop recovers most of that from what you breathe, sweat, and flush. The theft reduced that recovery. We counter with smart steps: conserve, repack, distill, and patrol. We do this together."

Colvern named the schedule. "Decks A and B wash Monday and Thursday. Decks C and D wash Tuesday and Friday. Decks E and F wash Wednesday and Saturday. Sunday stands for repairs and catch-ups under crew chief approval. Laundry runs for shipsuits and linens only. Personal loads pause. Galleys switch to low-water prep and dry scrubs between cycles. Hydro cuts misting by ten percent today and reviews plant stress daily."

Elias kept his piece practical. "Carry a water bottle," he urged. "Sip steady. Check urine color once a day. Lemonade color reads healthy. Apple juice color reads thirsty. Headaches and dizziness tell you to sit with salt and water, not push to finish a shift. Medical staff will be in the corridors with packets for oral rehydration. Use them. They work."

Patel closed with a shop list. "Turn off dripping taps," she urged. "Report warm spots on pipes. Run dish pits with the wash-pan method. Do not chase suds until they squeak. Clean does not equal froth. If you see a hose without a tag, tag it. If you own a hose without a need, store it with your deck chief. People fix what they understand. Here is what matters: every drop you keep saves ten down the line."

Rane finished with the tone that fits her house. "Wardens will walk with you," she told them. "We will bring tape and wrenches as often as we bring cuffs. We recognize honest mistakes. We respond to theft with speed. You find a water leak or a waste habit, you call it in with your name. You will receive thanks in public, not ridicule. We keep each other standing."

The ship returned to work with the quiet intensity that honest risk brings. Hydroponics trimmed roots and filled bins that smelled like clean earth and green stems. Engineering tore down scrubber frames and flowed black pellets into wash baskets that steamed under hot condensate. Procurement opened cages and logged out copper coil with a neat hand while the quartermaster bit the inside of his cheek and wrote "requisitioned for stills" under the brewery entry without grumbling. Wardens rolled through corridors with hoses over shoulders and clamps in pouches. They tightened, labeled, and logged. When they met a black-market sink with a makeshift sprayer, they folded it up and traded two tagged buckets without raised voices.

Elias and Kaela built a bio tower on a pallet in the utility bay with Muniz's crew cutting slots and Patel's crew placing trays. They layered gravel, netting, and damp root mat with a slow care that felt like planting a tree in a hard city. They bolted on clear panels so people could see the flow and believe in it. A pump hummed. Water trickled. The colony took its first breath of work.

By night, two towers flowed, and a third stood ready for morning. One still rattled promise on a test stand, and the vapor line condensed into a jar that read two gallons before midnight. The taste panel at the shop bench drew sips, grimaced at the first pass, and nodded at the second.

Wardens turned three barter corners quiet with confiscations and calm conversations that ended with handshakes more often than cuffs. Hale tightened six valves and left tags that read "fixed by Hale, thank a technician." Dax and two deckhands carried coil with the easy rhythm of men who like lifting for a purpose. Joren wrote numbers on a chalkboard outside the galley: gallons made, gallons saved, gallons spent. People paused, read, and moved on with a sense of belonging to a job, not just a ship.

Near midnight, Veynar and Colvern stood at the viewing pane over the plant room, watching water move through clear pipe like currency through a bank. "We bought time," Colvern measured, voice low. "We did it with scrap, muscle, and steady brains."

"We also owe a debt," Veynar returned. "Cold Mother brought bills. We will answer on her ground when the ship drinks without counting every cup."

Rane joined them with a short nod. "Wardens will pivot to escort," she reported. "Navigation charted the only reachable water world within our window. It carries brine flats, flash storms, and rough ground, yet it holds volume. We schedule lifts from a surface draw while Procurement routes a replacement shipment for the stolen media."

Colvern checked the still output once, then turned to the star chart. "We brief at first light," she agreed. "Operations stages tanks, pumps, and hose trains. Wardens ride every shuttle and hold the perimeter while crews pull water. We keep ration lines steady until Patel writes us a margin that lets people breathe."

Elias passed behind them with Kaela, both carrying trays of root mat for Tower Three. He met Colvern's eyes and offered one clean update. "The colony took," he reported, calm and clear. "It will build faster than worry if we feed it right."

"Feed it right," Colvern returned. "Then we draw clean water off that rock, keep our workers standing under Wardens' cover, and bridge to the new shipment without losing a day."

They parted to their tasks. The ship worked through the night the way good shops do when an order must go out and the only way forward sits through hard hours. By morning, the numbers at Joren's chalkboard would turn a shade better. By evening, the taste in the cup would carry fewer hints of chemistry and more of relief.

The loss hurt. The plan moved. Water took its rightful place as the first job of everyone aboard.
