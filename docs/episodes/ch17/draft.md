Chapter 17 - The Doctor's Ledger

The medical bay did not sound like the rest of the ship. The corridor outside kept a steady rhythm of boots, a soft rumble from the vents, and the faint vibration that lived in the deck plates. In here the air felt dense and still. White panels washed the room in a clean light. One panel over the corner flickered every few seconds and left a triangle of shadow that never settled. Two diagnostic stands rolled against the bulkhead with their cords coiled neat and tagged. The sterilizer in the prep alcove hummed like a held breath. The smell was sharp and familiar. Alcohol and coolant. A hint of gloves fresh from the box.

Elias sat at the central console with his shoulders rounded forward, hands braced on the edge as if he could steady the numbers by holding still. Liora's charts filled up the screen. Heart rate is steady. Oxygenation is fine. Capillary density is higher than yesterday. Basal temperature up again. He tracked the line with a fingertip, then pulled back and rubbed the spot away as if the gesture itself left a smudge.

On Earth he would have flagged this rise and taken the subject out of the queue. You did not let a graph slope up without asking why. Here the rules moved. Here you made judgment calls you could not defend in a classroom. He scrolled the archive for comparison and opened the last set of observation files. Geir. Two volunteers from the deck watch. One crew member from logistics. The spread made him tense. One bent toward sensitivity. One toward rejection. One showed almost nothing. No two cases were alike. He typed a short line and deleted it. Typed another and deleted that one too.

He pushed away from the console and crossed to a bank of drawers. Labels ran in neat rows. Splints. Sealant. Syringes. Test strips. He opened one drawer and closed it. Opened a second and closed it. He knew what was inside, but the motion helped him breathe. He returned to the chair, clicked open the case notes again, and forced himself to read from the top. The same facts stared back.

The hatch opened. Light from the corridor edged the floor, then closed again. Liora stepped inside, loose wrap tied at her waist, hair gathered but slipping at the sides. She looked fresher than he felt.

"You are hiding in here again," she said. Her voice carried humor but also quiet weariness.

"I needed to confirm your readings." He tried for a steady tone. "They are higher today."

She shrugged. "I feel fine. Warm, yes, but I could use that. Maybe when menopause hits I will be the only woman smiling through it. My mother complained for years about hot flashes. Drove the house mad. I will be the one laughing."

He forced a small smile. She always found a way to turn the edge. "It is not just the warmth I am worried about. It is the sustained elevation."

"Then write it in your charts. Give it a long name and it will sound less troubling." She walked closer and laid a hand on his shoulder. "Do not lose yourself in the numbers, Elias. Look at me. I am still here."

He covered her hand with his own and felt the heat under her skin. It wasn\'t a fever. It was something a bit more settled. Like glowing coals beneath a summer barbecue. He wanted to believe her. He wanted to let her joke carry them both. The numbers on his screen were clear. There was no comfort in them, and nothing reassuring.

"I will be back in a little while," she said, reading his face without pressing him. "You can tell me what you find."

When the hatch closed he exhaled and turned the work a different way. Reports about symptoms did not give him ground. He needed options. He called up the predeparture database they all pretended they had time to use. Thousands of entries sat there under tidy taxonomy. Animals. Plants. Fungal networks. Minerals. A long memory of ideas that never got enough funding back home.

He set three filters. Vascular function. Regenerative potential. Transport effects. The console hummed and thinned the list. Names marched up the screen. Some he knew by reputation. Some he only knew from notes that made it into conference posters no one read after the lights came down.

He worked the list with a slow hand. He checked each candidate against what they had already tried, then cross-checked against the ship's limits. No exotic reagents. No long growth cycles. No setups that needed rooms they did not have. He read abstracts and field notes. He opened old lab images that looked more like family pictures than science at this point.

One entry held. **Saphroot Mycelia.** A sterile strain documented during river flood studies on the coast. The lab note described spore factors that nudged nitric oxide pathways without blowing them out. The effect maps were clean. The doses were reasonable. The write-up was dry, which he trusted more than a glossy claim. If they could harvest a small starter from the seed bank, he could set a controlled microculture in a day and have trial volume in a week. He tagged it.

A second entry stood out for a different reason. **Velmari Skinmoss.** A symbiotic layer that favored high humidity surfaces and behaved like a living wick. Field notes recorded better skin perfusion scores in animal models and faster return to baseline after exertion. The action was simple and local. You did not need deep integration to see a benefit. It read like something that could be managed, observed, and reversed if you had to. He tagged it.

He pushed the list again and kept going until a third candidate felt solid enough for consideration. **Ferronox Shardlings.** The reports were cautious. The crystal microstructures produced stable micro-pulses in a tight field and showed promise for regulating vascular tone. He flipped through the figures twice and checked availability. The stores carried a small vial for sensor calibration. Not much, but enough to build a controlled setup if he took care. It offered a different mechanism from the first two. That mattered. You did not want three versions of the same idea.

He leaned back and let his eyes rest on the ceiling panel that flickered. Saphroot for flow. Velmari for local tissue support. Ferronox for tone and rhythm. Three distinct paths toward the same goal. None a repeat of what failed them last month and last week and yesterday.

His hands hovered over the keys as he framed the notes. He logged each candidate with clean language and plain steps. Small unit trials. Strict intake. Short windows. Build a safety wall you can retreat behind if needed. He wrote it like a protocol he would hand to a jury. He could hear Colonel Rane asking him why he needed all this structure and why he could not just take the simplest path. He kept writing anyway.

A knock on the hatch came quick and clipped. The logistics aide slid in with a slate and the look of someone sent to collect a thing he did not want to carry.

"Status for the colonel," the aide said. "She wants it before the next block."

"You will have it in ten minutes," Elias said. "Tell her I am filing three options for controlled trials and they are not delay for delay's sake. They are the fastest way to something that benefits everyone."

The aide nodded, glanced at the screens without understanding, and left as if the room itself pushed him out.

Elias saved the draft, then saved it again. He thought of Geir squinting at a light that felt too bright. He thought of the deck watch volunteer who went off simple meals for a week and then came right back. He thought of Liora this morning, cheeks pink, eyes calm, a warmth that settled the chill in their cabin even when the vents cycled wrong.

Not all side effects were bad. The sentence surprised him with how easy it came. He stared at it. The line was true and it was also dangerous if he let it stand alone. He did not want it to read like permission to chase what felt good without care. He typed the rest of the thought so no one could mistake him later.

*Observation: certain secondary outcomes may present as desirable to the subject or partner. Record without value language. Do not let preference skew risk assessment or trial design.*

He sat with that for a minute. How did he log what was happening between them without turning it into something small. The forms held fields for pulse rate and temp. They did not have a field for the way her warmth changed the air in the room or the way his shoulders dropped when she touched him. He entered what he could. Restlessness reported. Comfort improved with partner contact. Sleep disrupted then improved. He kept it plain.

He returned to the high level summary and typed the sentence that had tried to write itself earlier. This time he let it stand.

*No consistent side effects. Every splice introduces variance. Must assume shifts are intrinsic, not aberrant.*

He saved the file and pushed the slate aside. He rubbed both hands over his face and pressed his eyes until colors bloomed and faded. When he dropped his hands the hatch opened again.

Liora stood in the doorway with the same loose wrap, the belt knotted easy at her waist. Her hair had mostly fallen from its tie. She leaned a shoulder to the frame and watched him with a small smile that made the medbay feel less like a box.

"You are still chasing ghosts," she said.

"I finished." His voice sounded rough to him. "Three candidates marked. They make sense."

She crossed the room without hurry. The warmth reached him before her touch did. When her fingers rested on his shoulder it soaked through his shirt and sank deep.

"I told you not to drown in numbers," she said, softer this time. Her fingers traced the edge of his collar. "Come back with me."

"Liora." He tried to set the words the right way. He wanted to explain the care he had taken, the steps he had built, the trials he would defend in front of anyone who asked. None of that fit in the space between them.

"This heat is not just comfort," she said, a laugh under the words. "It stirs everything. I cannot sit still. I cannot sleep right. You are my fix, Elias. Do not make me beg."

She moved closer and the sterile smell of the room gave way to her skin. The wrap shifted as she leaned in. He felt his jaw unclench without meaning to. For a second he tried to hold on to the work and to the plan and to the version of himself that did not bend. Then her mouth found the line of his cheek and all the measured edges slipped.

He tapped the console closed and stood. She laced her fingers with his and drew him toward the hatch. The room stayed bright and impersonal behind them. The quiet followed them out.

They moved down the short corridor to their cabin. She stayed close, not in a rush, but with a clear pull. He could feel the heat she carried and the way it lifted in waves when she laughed under her breath. She pushed the door open with her shoulder and left the robe belt loose as if to make the point without a word. The light in their room sat lower and warmer than the medbay. The bed looked like a simple thing and also like the only answer that made sense.

He thought for a brief moment about the log. He wondered what line a future reader would draw from this night. He decided there was no line to draw that would not miss the center. He would note restlessness and relief. He would leave the rest between them.

Liora stepped back just enough to look at him and let the smile widen. "You can tell me about your three candidates after," she said. "You can make them sound very serious and I will nod and pretend I am not thinking about entirely different things."

"I will make them sound accurate," he said, and the steadiness in his voice surprised him.

"Good," she said. "Accuracy is a kind of kindness."

She led him in. The door sealed and the hum of the vents took on the softer sound of their small space. He set his slate on the table without looking at it. Her hand found his and tugged, and he let the pull carry him the last step.

Later, when the room had settled and the vents cycled cool and failed to make a difference, he lay awake with her head on his chest and thought through the sequence one more time. Saphroot for flow. Velmari for local tissue support. Ferronox for tone and rhythm. He could hear the cadence of how he would present it. He could hear Rane's questions and the way he would answer without raising his voice. He could hear the logistics officer asking about materials and he could see the shelf where the small vial sat. He could also feel Liora's slow breathing and the way his own chest matched it without trying.

He eased out of bed after she drifted and pulled on his shirt. He crossed back to the medbay while the ship held its soft night. He wanted the report filed before anyone could ask for it again with that tight, impatient look. The room met him the same way it always did. The panel in the corner flickered. The sterilizer hummed. The chair creaked when he sat.

He sent the file to the colonel's queue with the flag that marked it as ready. He added one last note so no one could claim later that he had hidden hope inside the work or had shaped the work to suit the hope.

*Record all outcomes without apology for comfort or discomfort. Preference has no place in the risk column. Preference also does not erase lived relief.*

He let the cursor blink at the end of the sentence until it stopped looking like a metronome and started looking like a quiet light. He saved and locked the file.

He read the header aloud to the empty room because sometimes the act of speaking made a thing feel real. "Patterns of variance," he said. "Three candidates. Controlled windows. We do it clean or we do not do it." Saying it out loud steadied him more than he expected.

He stood, turned off the console, and glanced once at the drawers along the wall. He did not open them. He did not need the ritual. He knew what was inside and he knew what came next.

Back in the cabin he slid under the sheet and the warmth found him at once. Liora stirred, tucked closer without waking, and settled again. He put a hand between her shoulder blades and felt the steady heat there like a small sun, steady and kind and not a thing you could chart with any instrument he owned.

In the morning he would explain the three paths in simple words. He would ask for space to do it right. He would make the case and keep the door shut on shortcuts. He would log what he could and leave the rest alone.

For now the medbay's last image hung in his head. A single line of text bright on a quiet screen:

*No consistent side effects. Every splice introduces variance. Must assume shifts are intrinsic, not aberrant.*
