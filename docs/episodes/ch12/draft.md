Chapter 12 - Edges of the Possible

The range smelled like hot metal and old oil. Joren stood behind the line with the others, ear caps in place and stance set. Targets rolled out on the tracks and stopped at mid distance. The instructor raised a hand. The room went quiet in that way a first test makes a group hold still.

"Three round groupings. On my mark. Low ready."

Joren set the rifle into the shelf of his shoulder. His pulse touched the stock: steady but loud in his head. This first volley would decide whether he stayed in the top-lane rotation or dropped to remedial. He wanted the top lane. He wanted to stop being the courier kid who carried pouches and jokes to the clinic. He wanted a real post and a day when no one looked past him when things were hard.

"Mark."

He pressed the trigger. The report cracked down the lane. First shot: left. He corrected a hair and sent the second. The third followed a breath later. The target rocked and rolled back toward the catch. The instructor walked the line with a quick look over each bench, took the printouts, then paused at Joren's station.

"Lane five. Tight group. Good correction. You pull left on the first round. Fix the start. Do not rely on the second shot to clean it up."

"Yes, sir."

"Again."

The next set came cleaner. The rifle started to feel like a tool he had known for longer than a month. He let himself like that feeling: not the blast or the stink, but the control. On the third set a red light flashed on the far wall and a door opened. Two handlers rolled in a heat box on a dolly and parked it near the firing line. A thin shimmer rose from the vents.

"Simulation B," the instructor called. "Ambient climbs. Gloves on if you have not done heat drills. Keep it short if you feel pressure behind the eyes."

Joren pulled on the thin range gloves and flexed his fingers. The heat pressed close without tipping to harsh. Two lanes over, Hale muttered under her breath the way she did when turning a habit into focus and keeping it from superstition.

"Mark."

He fired again. The air picked up the bite of burned powder and hot oil. Sweat traced a line down his back that he knew would print when he stripped the shirt. Two rounds landed tight, one flew high. He lowered the rifle, filed the miss without a face.

The instructor lifted a hand: "Hydrate. Five minutes."

Joren stepped off the line, took a long pull from his bottle, then looked through the safety glass into the corridor. Kaela stood there with a slate against her chest and a smile that started in her eyes. She lifted two fingers. Not a wave. A small signal: I am here.

He wanted to go to her and he wanted to hold his place on the line. He pointed at the clock. Kaela nodded and mouthed that she would wait.

He finished the rotation and managed one more tight set. After he cleared the rifle and signed the board, he took the corridor at a quick walk.

"How did it feel?" Kaela asked.

"Better than last week," he answered. "Still pulling that first shot left if I do not remind my hands they are attached to a brain." He grinned. "You look like you are carrying a secret."

She laughed softly. "I am. Lab four. It is not the kind that makes your father mad, I think."

They took the service stairwell rather than the main lift. Kaela kept a steady pace, slate tucked under her arm, thoughts moving behind her eyes in the way he had learned to read over the past year. When she was turning something over, the best thing he could do was keep station and not fill the air with noise.

Lab four was half full. A tech in a cap calibrated a scope at one bench. At another, a student counted gauze squares and pretended not to listen. Kaela tapped her card, slipped past the curtain at the back, and led him into the small room beyond where the air unit hummed louder. On the work tray sat a sealed dish with a Sunfan lattice sample no larger than a nail clipping. Next to it lay a thin slide with a smear of blood already dried to a brown shadow.

"Your mother?" he asked.

Kaela nodded. "She consented. She is starting to show more. Nothing dramatic. Mornings she is colder to the touch, and she does not burn when she cooks anymore. We logged it last month." She opened the slate. "I ran a controlled micro exposure with a buffer layer. No direct contact. The lattice did not bond to the cells. It did signal."

"Signal how?"

"Rate of repair," she said. "It ticked up under stress and then fell back when I removed the stimulus. It is a small change, but not noise. I triple checked the control."

He leaned over the reader. "You found a switch."

"A switch is a big word," Kaela said. "Call it a nudge. The point is that I can watch it happen. I can push and map the response."

"Does your father know?"

"Not yet." She shut the slate slightly so only the edge showed. "I do not want him to hear the word useful and stop at the wrong part. I will bring him the data when I have a curve he can trust."

Joren looked from the slide to her. She had grown into this place: not the clinic floor or the patient chair, but the bench, the graph, the quiet that sits close when an answer is near. It fit her, though he felt a small unease at how calm she was over something others called an edge.

"Show me."

Kaela set the dish in the reader, pulled up the overlay, and drew a circle on the screen with a fingertip. The trace ran thin, almost a straight line. She tapped a command and the line rose a fraction, held, then eased back down.

"It does that every time. Not very much, but enough to chart."

"What happens if you push harder?"

"I am not about to push harder." Her voice tightened. "This isn\'t a game."

He lifted his hands. "Sorry. I\'m still in range brain."

She let a small smile out. "Range brain is allowed." She shut down the reader and resealed the dish. "I need a peer to sit on this with me. Not my father. Not Mira. Someone who will not turn it into a protocol tomorrow."

"Nyra," Joren offered. "She understands the plates and knows how to keep a secret without breaking the law."

"Mostly is not the comfort you think it is," Kaela nodded. "I will ask her for time. Quietly."

The door clicked and a nurse poked her head in. "Sorry. I did not know this bench was booked."

"It is clear now," Kaela said, tucking the slate into her pocket. She looked at Joren. "Walk me to the plant wall?"

"Always."

They walked the long way past the observation windows. The outer hull kept its old gray and the corner rails kept their scuffs, but faces in the corridors had shifted: more Procurement armbands, more families holding the brittle calm of people who had signed forms and were treating those forms like promises. Joren felt the weight of his badge and the echo of the rifle stock against his shoulder. He thought about the heat box and how the firing room changed when it rolled in. He thought about Kaela's small rise on the screen.

"Do you like it?"

"The rifle? I like doing something that matters. I like not being the kid with a pouch. I do not like the part where I think about using it on a person."

"Then you are fine. The ones who like that part should be watched."

They reached the plant wall. Cooler air. Kaela set her slate on the bench and rested her head on his shoulder. He closed his eyes for a moment and let the world shrink to three things: a lab finding that might be a key, a range score he could still raise, and the girl whose breath he had learned to count.

They sat beside the ferns. Vents cycled. A drip clicked somewhere out of sight. Kaela watched a bead of water crawl down a leaf and fall without sound.

"I used to come here when I was scared. Not the big kind. The kind that sits in your throat and waits for reason."

"And now?"

"Now I come to think. Thinking is harder than fear. It stays."

He let that sit. The quiet did not ask for an answer. He took her hand, palm to palm. Her fingers felt cool at first, then warm. She turned her head a little; a small crease showed near her eye, the one that came when she was tired.

"You do not have to carry all of it."

"I know. If I put it down, someone else picks it up wrong."

They shared a small, private smile: too many busy days, not enough sleep. Overhead lights softened as the ship moved to the next cycle. A family crossed behind the glass---child counting tiles, father pretending not to notice. The view slid on and the plant wall held the space again.

"Do I get a selfish request?" Joren drew a steady breath that felt like it belonged here.

"Maybe. Depends on the request."

"After drills, before the next shift, can I sit here with you and not say anything clever for once?"

"That is rare. I accept."

They turned toward each other at the same moment. Not staged. Not a story beat. Just two people reaching the same thought. He searched her face. She had already decided. A small lift of her chin. He leaned in. The kiss was deliberate and slow: no rush, no proof, only the press that means I am here and I will not leave when the clock moves on.

A footstep at the far end. A soft cough. They eased apart by an inch and kept their hands linked. A cleaner pushed a cart past the glass and studied the mop head like it mattered. One squeak of the wheels, then gone. Kaela's laugh stayed under her breath.

"That was almost dramatic."

"I can trip over the bench if you want more drama."

"No. I like you vertical. It helps with range scores."

He bumped her shoulder. She bumped back. The clock above the hatch put the next cycle close. He did not want to stand. He also wanted to keep his slot in the top lane. Both wants were true. That was the year.

"Walk you to the lift?"

"In a minute. Promise me something first."

He straightened a little. "Name it."

"Do not talk about my mother's numbers out loud. Not to trainees. Not to your friends. Not as a joke. Not at all."

"I would not."

"Say it anyway."

"I will not talk about your mother's numbers. Not to anyone. If someone asks, I will say I do not know what they mean."

"Good." She tapped the slate pocket. "I will loop Nyra in, but that will be my choice, not a rumor."

"Understood. My promise back to you: if your work draws heat from the wrong people, I will be the first body in the doorway."

\"That is a very Warden thing to say,\" she said.

"That sounds like me." He kept his tone even. "I am still me."

Her hand tightened around his. "Good. Keep being you. I do not need a hero. I need you to show up, bring water, and listen."

"I can do that. Water, listening, and the occasional perfect grouping."

"Do not get greedy." A smile touched her mouth.

A ping lit his wrist. He checked the alert and blinked. "Top lane next week. Barely. I made the cut."

"I knew you would."

"You did not even watch the first set."

"I did not need to. You look different when you are about to do something well. Your eyes go quiet."

He tucked that away for later and leaned in. The kiss was brief, more promise than question. When they parted, she stood and lifted her slate.

"Range boy."

"Lab girl."

They headed for the lift. Corridor noise met them in a steady wash. Joren watched how she threaded through a knot of people without brushing a shoulder, how she kept the slate snug at her side like standard kit. He felt the weight of his badge, the clean ache in his arms from drills. Awake. Useful.

"Tonight," she said as the doors opened. "Plant wall, if your rotation does not swallow you."

"I will make it."

"Then I will be there."

The doors slid shut and carried her toward the lab deck. He stayed a moment, catching his reflection in the steel and the faint oil smudge on his collar, then cut to the stairwell and ran down two flights to sign in for his next block. On the way he touched the railing with the same hand that had held hers and let the day stack in order.

Back at the bench, the drip line clicked: steady, small. If anyone noticed a young Warden trainee taking the long way to the range, no one mentioned it. The hour turned. Joren moved with it.
