Chapter 12 - Edges of the Possible

The range smelled like hot metal and old oil. Joren stood behind the line with the others, ear caps in, stance set. Targets rolled out on tracks until they stopped at mid distance. The instructor raised a hand. The room sank into that waiting quiet that comes before a first test.

\"Three round groupings. On my mark,\" the instructor said. \"Low ready.\"

Joren brought the rifle down to the shelf of his shoulder. He felt the beat of his own pulse against the stock, steady but too loud in his head. The first volley would decide whether he stayed in the top lane rotation or slid back to remedial. He wanted top lane. He wanted to stop being the courier kid who brought pouches and jokes to the clinic. He wanted to stand a post and not have anyone look past him when things were hard.

\"Mark.\"

Joren squeezed. The report cracked down the lane. His first shot landed left. He made a tiny correction and sent the second. The third followed a breath later. The target shivered and drifted back toward the catch. The instructor walked the line once, eyes moving without comment, then took the printouts from the machine.

\"Lane five,\" the instructor said. \"Tight group. Good correction. You tended to pull left on the first round. Fix the start. Do not rely on the second shot to save the first.\"

\"Yes, sir,\" Joren said.

\"Again.\"

The next set came cleaner. Joren felt the rifle settle into him like a tool he had known longer than a month. He let himself like the feeling. Not the noise, not the smell, but the control. On the third set, the red light at the far wall flashed and a door opened. Two handlers rolled in a heat box on a dolly and parked it near the firing line. A thin heat shimmer climbed off the box.

\"Simulation B,\" the instructor said. \"Ambient rises. Gloves on for anyone who has not done heat drills. Keep it short if you feel pressure behind the eyes.\"

Joren flexed his fingers in the thin range gloves. The heat was not terrible, just close. He could hear Hale two lanes over, muttering to herself in the way she did when she was trying to keep a habit from turning into a superstition.

\"Mark.\"

He fired again. The smell of the room deepened. Sweat ran down the curve of his back and made a line in the shirt that he knew would print when he pulled it off. The target caught two tight rounds and one high. He lowered the rifle, annoyed at the high, and kept his face blank.

\"Hydrate,\" the instructor said. \"Five minutes.\"

Joren stepped back, took a pull from his bottle, and looked through the safety glass at the corridor. Kaela stood there with a slate hugged to her chest, watching him with a smile that started in her eyes. She lifted two fingers, not a wave, just a small signal that said she was there.

He wanted to go to her. He also wanted to hold his place on the line. He pointed at the clock. She nodded and mouthed, \"I will wait.\"

He finished the rotation and managed one more tight set. When he cleared the rifle and signed the board, he took the corridor at a quick walk.

\"How did it feel?\" Kaela asked.

\"Better than last week,\" he said. \"Still pulling that first shot left if I do not remind my hands that they are attached to a brain.\" He grinned. \"You look like you are carrying a secret.\"

\"I am,\" she said. \"Lab four. And it is not the kind that makes your father mad. I think.\"

They walked together through the service stairwell rather than take the main lift. Kaela set a steady pace, slate tucked under her arm, thoughts clearly running. Joren let the quiet sit. He had learned that about her this past year. When she was turning something over, the best thing he could do was keep station and not fill the air with his own noise.

Lab four was half full. A tech in a cap calibrated a scope. A student at the far bench counted out squares of gauze and pretended not to listen to anything. Kaela tapped her card, slid past the curtain at the back, and led Joren into the small room beyond. The hum of the air unit was louder here. On the work tray sat a sealed dish with a Sunfan lattice sample no larger than a nail clipping. Next to it, a thin slide with a smear of blood already dried to a brown shadow.

\"Your mother?\" Joren asked.

Kaela nodded. \"She consented. She is starting to show more. Nothing dramatic. She is colder to the touch in the morning and she does not burn when she cooks anymore. We logged that last month.\" She opened the slate. \"I ran a controlled micro exposure with a buffer layer. No direct contact. The lattice did not bond to the cells. But it did signal.\"

\"Signal how?\"

\"Rate of repair,\" Kaela said. \"It ticked up under stress and then dropped back when I removed the stimulus. It is a small change, but it is not noise. I triple checked the control.\"

Joren leaned in. \"You found a switch.\"

\"A switch is a big word,\" she said. \"Call it a nudge. The point is, I can see it happen. I can push and watch the response. That means I can map it.\"

\"Does your father know?\"

\"Not yet,\" Kaela said. \"I do not want to tell him that his wife is a useful test case. He will hear only the word useful and not the part where I am careful. I will bring him the data when I have a curve he can trust.\"

Joren looked from the slide to Kaela. She had grown into this place. Not the clinic floor, not the patient chair, but the bench and the graph and the quiet that comes when an answer is close. It fit her, even if it scared him a little to see how calm she was with something everyone else was calling an edge.

\"Show me,\" he said.

Kaela set the dish in the reader, brought up the overlay, and drew a circle on the screen with her finger. The trace was thin, almost a straight line. She tapped a command. The line rose a fraction, held, then eased back down.

\"It does that every time,\" she said. \"Not a lot. Enough to chart.\"

\"What happens if you push harder?\"

\"I do not push harder,\" Kaela said. \"This is not a game.\"

He put up his hands. \"Sorry. I am still in range brain.\"

She smiled. \"Range brain is allowed.\" She shut down the reader and sealed the dish again. \"I need a peer to sit on this with me. Not my father. Not Mira. Someone who will not try to turn it into a protocol tomorrow.\"

\"Nyra,\" Joren said. \"She understands the plates and she knows how to keep a secret without breaking the law. Mostly.\"

\"Mostly is not the comfort you think it is,\" Kaela said, but she nodded. \"I will ask her for time. Quietly.\"

The door clicked and a nurse stuck her head in. \"Sorry. I did not know this bench was booked.\"

\"It is clear now,\" Kaela said. She pocketed the slate and looked at Joren. \"Walk me to the plant wall?\"

\"Always.\"

They took the long route past the observation windows. The ship wore the same old gray, the same scuffs on the corner rails, but the faces in the corridors had changed. More armbands from Procurement. More families with the brittle calm of people who have signed forms and are pretending those forms are a promise. Joren felt the weight of his badge and the echo of the rifle stock against his shoulder. He thought about the heat box and the way the room smelled when it rolled in. He thought about Kaela's little rise on the screen.

\"Do you like it?\" Kaela asked.

\"The rifle?\" he said. \"I like doing something that matters. I like not being the kid with a pouch. I do not like the part where I think about using it on a person.\"

\"Then you are fine,\" she said. \"The ones who like that part should be watched.\"

They reached the plant wall. The air was cooler there. Kaela set her slate on the bench and leaned her head on his shoulder. He closed his eyes for a moment and let the world be only this: a lab secret that might be a key, a range score he could improve, and the girl he still loved enough to count time by her breath.

They sat on the bench by the plant wall. The ferns made a soft whisper as the vents cycled. A small drip line clicked somewhere out of sight. Kaela kept her head on his shoulder and watched a single bead of water creep down a leaf and fall without a sound.

\"I used to come here when I was scared,\" she said. \"Not big scared. Just the kind that sits in your throat and waits for a reason.\"

\"What about now?\"

\"Now I come here to think,\" she said. \"Thinking is harder than fear. It stays.\"

He let that sit. The quiet did not ask for an answer. He took her hand, palm to palm, nothing more. Her fingers were cool at first, then warmer. She turned her head a little. He could see the small crease near her eye that showed up when she was tired.

\"You do not have to carry all of it,\" he said.

\"I know,\" she said. \"But if I put it down, someone else picks it up wrong.\"

They both smiled at that, the private kind that belongs only to people who have shared too many busy days and not enough sleep. The overhead lights softened a shade as the ship moved to the next cycle. A family passed behind the glass, a child counting floor tiles, a father pretending not to see the counting. The corridor took them away and the plant wall gave the space back.

Joren took a breath that felt like it belonged here. \"Do I get to make a selfish request?\"

\"Maybe,\" she said. \"Depends on the request.\"

\"After drills, before the next shift, can I sit here with you and not say anything smart for once.\"

\"That is a rare offer,\" she said. \"I accept.\"

They turned toward each other at the same time. It was not planned. It did not feel like a movie. It felt like both of them finally picking the same thought. He searched her face to be sure. She was already sure. She lifted her chin just enough. He leaned in. The kiss was simple and slow. No rush. No proof. Just the press and hold that says I am here and I am not leaving as soon as the clock clicks over.

A footstep sounded at the far end of the corridor. A soft cough. They pulled apart by an inch but did not let go of each other's hands. A cleaner pushed a cart past the glass and pretended to be deeply interested in the mop head. The cart wheels squeaked once and were gone. Kaela laughed under her breath.

\"That was almost dramatic,\" she said.

\"I can trip over the bench if you want more drama,\" he said.

\"No,\" she said. \"I like you vertical. It helps with the range scores.\"

He bumped his shoulder lightly against hers. She bumped back. The clock above the hatch showed the next cycle rolling closer. He did not want to stand. He also wanted to keep his slot in top lane. Both wants were true. That was the kind of year it had been.

\"Walk you to the lift?\" he asked.

\"In a minute,\" she said. \"There is something I need you to promise first.\"

He sat up a little. \"Name it.\"

\"Do not talk about my mother's numbers out loud. Not to the trainees. Not to your friends. Not on a joke. Not at all.\"

\"I would not,\" he said.

\"I know,\" she said. \"Say it anyway.\"

\"I will not talk about your mother's numbers. Not to anyone,\" he said. \"If someone asks, I do not know what they are asking about.\"

She nodded. \"Good. I will loop Nyra in, but I want that to be my choice, not a rumor.\"

\"Understood,\" he said. \"One more promise from me to you. If your work turns into heat from the wrong people, I will be the first body in the doorway.\"

\"That is a very Warden thing to say,\" she said.

\"It is also a very Joren thing to say,\" he said. \"I am still me.\"

She squeezed his hand. \"Good. Keep being you. I do not need a hero. I need you to show up and bring water and listen.\"

\"I can do that,\" he said. \"Water, listening, and the occasional perfect grouping.\"

\"Do not get greedy,\" she said, but she was smiling.

A message pinged on his wrist. He checked it and blinked. \"Top lane for next week,\" he said. \"Barely. I made the cut.\"

\"I knew you would,\" she said.

\"You did not even watch the first set,\" he said.

\"I did not need to,\" she said. \"You look different when you are about to do something well. Your eyes go quiet.\"

He did not know what to do with that, so he filed it away under things he would think about later and leaned in for another kiss. This one was shorter, more of a promise than a question. When they parted, she stood and picked up her slate.

\"Range boy,\" she said.

\"Lab girl,\" he said.

They started for the lift. The corridor hum met them like a steady tide. Joren watched the way she threaded through a knot of people without bumping a shoulder, the way she carried the slate against her side like it was part of her. He felt the weight of his own badge and the ache in his arms from the afternoon drills. He felt awake. He felt useful.

\"Tonight,\" she said as the lift doors opened. \"Plant wall again if your rotation does not eat you.\"

\"I will make it,\" he said.

\"Then I will be here,\" she said.

The doors slid shut and took her up toward the lab deck. He stood there a moment longer, looking at his reflection in the steel and the faint smudge of oil on his collar. Then he turned and ran the stairwell two flights down to sign in for his next block. On his way, he touched the railing with the same hand that had held hers and let the day line up behind him in a way that felt right.

Back at the bench, the drip line clicked again, steady and small. If anyone noticed a young Warden trainee taking the long way to the range, they did not say. The ship moved on to the next hour. Joren did too.
