Chapter 03 --

"Midday at the plant wall in the commons, where the light smells a little like water and leaves."

The pumps under the wall kept a gentle rhythm. A mist nozzle clicked and sent a thin veil across the ferns. Voices in the market drifted in soft waves, bright and close, then far and small.

Kaela reached into her satchel and brought out a small bundle wrapped in brown paper. "I made these in class," she said. "The teacher called it applied geometry. I call it a way to make quiet look like a gift."

Joren arrived at a quick walk that stopped short of a run, as if the air itself had asked him to slow down near the greenery. His Guild tunic carried a mark of dust at one shoulder and a scuff at one knee that looked like a story he had not told yet. He set a sealed courier pouch on the bench between them, then placed a tiny music chip beside it.

"The music chip promised sunrise," he said. "It keeps its promises."

Kaela opened the paper. Inside lay three small flowers folded from map pages, each petal crisp and careful, each center stitched with a single thread. "Now the plant wall has cousins," she said. "One flower for you. One flower for the wall. One flower for later, in case later needs a reason."

Joren took the smallest flower and held it like a fragile machine he hoped to understand. "I do not deserve a map," he said. "I get lost in straight corridors."

"Maps are not for people who know where they are," Kaela said. "Maps are for people who plan to move."

A tram bell sounded in the near distance, two notes up, two notes down. Joren glanced toward the sound, then back. "I can stay," he said. "The pouch is for Medical, Sector Ten. It can wait for one song."

"Let it wait for three breaths," Kaela said, and smiled so he would hear the tease. "Bring the chip to life first."

She liked teasing him because color rose fast in his cheeks and then he smiled with his whole face. She liked giving him a small rule and seeing him follow it with care. Today she wanted his breaths, so she watched his chest and counted softly with him. "One," she said. "Two." She leaned closer, set the paper flower against his tunic just above the Guild stitching, and smoothed the crease with two fingers. His skin warmed under the collar. "Three."

Joren tipped his head, pleased to be trusted with timing. "Three breaths is a fair price for music," he said. "I will pay in full."

Kaela kept her hand on the flower a heartbeat longer. "Payment received," she said. "Play it."

He slid the chip into the player. The first guitar notes opened like a slow curtain. Kaela watched a brighter color move along his cheekbones. She wanted that color. She wanted the way his eyes lifted when she spoke his name. She let the music fill the space between them and then she nudged the sealed pouch with a knuckle. "You brought dust on your sleeve," she said, light and kind. "It looks like a story."

"It is a short story," Joren said. "A crate kissed me, and I bowed."

She laughed and let the laugh sit where he could feel proud of it. "Good. Keep the crate as a friend," she said. "Friends help with timing."

He breathed in once more, as if to test the rule again, and the color returned like a secret that liked being found.

"I like the first minute best," Kaela said. "It feels like a door that does not need to be forced."

Joren watched her hands as she folded the paper band into a ring for the bench slat. Her right fingers trembled once. She paused, breathed in for a count, out for two counts, then reset her grip. The tremor eased. He kept his gaze on the flower so that she would not feel watched.

"Thank you for not saying anything," Kaela said.

"I saw that you had it," Joren said. "You told it who was in charge. It listened."

Kaela laughed, small and true. "I like a friend who knows the difference between rescue and respect."

"Good," Joren said. "I can bring both, but respect arrives first."

They sat with the music. The plant wall breathed. A child ran past with a kite made from a market bag and two sticks. The kite dipped, rose, dipped, and found a glide.

"I want to tell you something that belongs to me," Kaela said. "Not a secret. A truth."

"I am here," Joren said.

"I am afraid of being a symbol," she said. "People see my father's job and my mother's illness and my tremor, and they start composing a song I did not ask them to write. I want to be part of the work without becoming a message."

Joren turned the paper flower in his fingers. "I hear you," he said. "I do not write songs about people who are standing right in front of me. I only ask questions."

"You may ask one," Kaela said.

"What feels like yours, even on a bad day," Joren asked.

"My breath," Kaela said. "It belongs to me. It is not dramatic. It is steady. I can count it. When the tremor arrives, the breath does not run away."

Joren nodded. "Mine is a route I draw in my head before my feet move. When the lift is full, and the tram is slow, and the clerk wants me to wait, I walk the whole errand in my mind first. Then the body follows."

Kaela looked toward the corridor where the lift doors opened and closed like a tide. "You are good at being seventeen," she said.

"I have practiced," Joren said. "I plan to be even better at eighteen."

A small group of students stopped at the plant wall to take a photograph. One of them asked Kaela if the paper flowers were for sale. Kaela smiled and said no, then said, "They are not for sale today," which left the door open for a different day that might want a stall and a sign and a jar for coins.

The music softened into a last chord. Joren flicked the player off and set the chip next to the map flowers.

"Tell me one thing you want that is simple," he said.

"Simple," Kaela said. She thought for a breath. "I want to hear a turbine without smelling oil. I want to sit in a seat that looks at a sky and says, this belongs to us, even if the sky is a screen."

"I can give you half of that," Joren said. "I cannot lend you the sky, but I can walk you to the hangar overlook. It is loud, yet it feels like purpose, not like threat. The floor hums in a way that makes your shoulder blades agree with your spine."

Kaela laughed again. "You talk like a person who has leaned on a railing and learned its language."

"I have," Joren said. "The railing said, bring company next time."

A soft tone sounded overhead. The public channel spoke in a neutral voice. "Notice. Procurement briefing at second bell on Deck One. Authorized personnel only. Notice."

Joren glanced at the sealed pouch and made a face like a person who accepts that the world has its own tempo. "That tone means I should not be late," he said. "Captain Draeven dislikes it when couriers sprint with paperwork."

"You can walk fast without sprinting," Kaela said. "My mother says speed is not a moral category."

"Your mother is wise," Joren said. "I will see you after your last class. I will bring the bench if the one we like is taken."

"I will bring two paper flowers," Kaela said. "We will adopt another slat."

Joren stood, then offered his hand as if he were asking permission to help and not assuming it. Kaela took it and rose with a steady motion that pleased her. He released her hand without delay.

"Thank you for the song," she said.

"Thank you for the map," he said. "I will not get lost if I carry it."

He lifted the pouch, gave her a small salute that felt more like a promise than a performance, and headed toward the corridor that led to the radial lift. His steps were quick and even. The pouch sat balanced on his forearm. He did not look back because he knew she would be watching and he wanted to give her the gift of choosing when to look away.

Kaela watched until he turned the corner. Then she sat and listened to the pumps under the wall until she could hear her own pulse echo the rhythm. She placed the third flower in her satchel, closed the clasp, and rested both hands on the bench. The plant wall smelled like damp stone and green light. She found the breath she liked best, the one that began in her belly and climbed without hurry to the top of her chest, and she said aloud for the wall to keep, "I will be part of the work. I will not be a message. I will be a person doing a job that matters."

A market bell rang from the far end of the commons. The crowd shifted. Somewhere in the bright noise, a baby laughed and learned what echo means. Kaela rose, lifted her satchel, and felt the pleasant weight of paper and slate and music. The tram bell sounded again, two notes up, two notes down. She stepped into the stream of people and let it carry her toward the classroom steps.

"Later that afternoon, at the hangar overlook above Deck One, where turbines warm the air and voices carry like ropes."

The overlook rail held the vibration of engines that waited for orders. Air smelled of oil and heat and the metallic sweet the decon team used on floor drains. Below, crew moved with the tidy speed of a well practiced song. Armor clasps clicked. Net cannons thumped as they locked into racks. A crane sang a slow arc as it lifted a cage into place.

Kaela set her palms on the rail and felt the hum rise through her bones. Joren came up beside her with a fresh scuff on his sleeve and a grin that had learned restraint in front of officers.

"I walked, and I was still on time," he said. "The railing approves."

"It does," Kaela said. "It told me you would be back."

On the floor below, Captain Draeven stood with Specialist Hale and two others from the squad. Dr. Elias Tharros spoke with them. Mira Jeylan hurried across with a clipboard and a box of tagged vials. Nyra Solwyn leaned against a crate and watched the big door at the far end as if the door might have a private signal only she could hear.

The public address voice cleared its throat. "Briefing will begin at second bell," it said. "Authorized personnel report to the marked circle."

Joren pointed toward a chalk ring on the floor where the team gathered. "That is the circle that means attention," he said. "I like circles. They make people look at one another."

Kaela saw her father lift a small speaker and press a button. A low tone came through the hangar, not loud, just present. It sounded like the Lattice Suite when a model began to behave.

"Listen," Kaela said. "That tone means the plates on the model are starting to share load."

"How do you know," Joren asked.

"I spend time in my father's head," Kaela said. "By accident, and then on purpose."

Joren nodded once, as if he had expected that answer and was glad to hear it anyway. "Do you want to stay for the first minutes," he asked. "We can leave when the doors open. I can walk you to the lift before the launch."

"I want to hear the beginning," Kaela said. "I like beginnings. They make the middle feel possible."

Below, her father spoke in a clear voice that carried without strain. "When a Sunfan beast heats up, the armor opens like a folding fan and pulls into a curve. Pilots, fly that curve. Do not fly a straight line. A straight line will shear the net. Couplers hold best when we match its path. Our aim is a live capture with low stress"

Captain Draeven nodded and pointed to the cage. "No bravado," he said. "We bring the doctor a reason to work, and we bring everyone home."

Specialist Hale checked a tranquilizer array, then looked up toward the overlook. She spotted Kaela and gave a single small nod that felt like recognition rather than comfort. Kaela returned the nod. Joren lifted two fingers in a quiet salute he reserved for people who had earned it.

A warning chime sounded. The big door at the far end of the hangar unsealed with a long breath. The air changed. The floor hum deepened a degree. Kaela felt the hairs rise along her forearms.

"I will walk you to the lift," Joren said.

"Thank you," Kaela said. "I will listen for the turbines when the doors close."

They stepped back from the rail and moved with the flow that had approached to watch. Voices rose, then fell, then rose again. The tram bell answered from the corridor with the same two notes that marked the commons. The ship spoke in chimes and tones and the low breath of engines. It sounded like a place that believed in work.

At the lift, Joren pressed the call. The doors opened with a soft sigh. Kaela stepped inside, then turned to face him.

"Bring me back a story that does not smell like fear," she said.

"I will bring you a story that smells like dust and heat and a net that found the right curve," Joren said. "I will also bring the bench."

"I will bring the flowers," Kaela said.

The doors slid closed. The lift took her up toward the school corridor. Joren stood for a moment in the hangar air, then turned and jogged back toward the chalk circle, where voices were already counting checks, and where a turbine, somewhere deep in the body of the ship, cleared its throat and began to sing.
