Chapter 03 -- Sunrise Promise

"Midday at the plant wall in the commons, where the light smells a little like water and leaves."

The pumps under the wall kept a gentle rhythm. A mist nozzle clicked and cast a thin veil across the ferns. Voices in the market rose and fell in soft waves.

Kaela reached into her satchel and set a small bundle wrapped in brown paper on the bench. "I made these in class. The teacher called it applied geometry. I call it a way to make homework look like a gift."

Joren arrived at a quick walk that slowed near the greenery. His Guild tunic showed a dust mark at one shoulder and a scuff at one knee that looked like a story still waiting. He laid a sealed courier pouch on the bench, then a tiny music chip beside it.

"Here is the music chip. I promised a sunrise. Tell me if I kept it."

Kaela opened the paper. Three small flowers folded from map pages rested inside, each petal crisp, each center stitched with a single thread. "Now the plant wall has cousins. One flower for you and one for the wall. The last is for later, in case later needs a reason."

Joren chose the smallest and held it like a fragile machine he meant to learn. "I do not deserve a map. I probably need one. I can get lost in straight corridors."

"Hey, silly. Maps are not for people who know where they are. Maps are for people who plan to be on the move."

A tram bell sounded nearby, two notes up, two notes down. Joren glanced toward it, then back. "I can stay a bit. The pouch is for Medical in Sector Ten. It can wait while we listen to one more song."

"Let it wait for three breaths." She smiled so he would hear the tease. "Bring the chip to life first."

Color climbed his cheeks. He smiled with his whole face. She liked giving him a small rule and watching him follow it with care.

"Count with me." she said, eyes on his chest.

"One." His breath eased out.

"Two." She leaned closer, set the paper flower against his tunic just above the Guild stitching, and smoothed the crease with two fingers. Warmth met her knuckles at his collar.

"Three." Their faces hovered inches apart, the plant wall's mist turning the light to a hush.

Joren tipped his head, not trusting himself to be so close. "Three breaths is a fair price for music. I will happily pay in full."

Kaela kept her hand on the flower a heartbeat longer. "Payment received." She giggled. "Play it now."

He slid the chip into the player. The first guitar notes opened like a slow curtain. A brighter color moved along his cheekbones. She wanted that color, and the way his eyes lifted when she said his name. She let the music fill the small space between them, then nudged the sealed pouch with her knuckle. "You brought dust on your sleeve." she said, gentle. "It looks like a story."

"It is a short story." Joren replied. "A crate kissed me, and I bowed."

She laughed and let the sound sit where he could be proud. "Good. Keep the crate as a friend." she said. "Friends help with timing."

He breathed in once more, testing the rule, and the color returned like a secret that liked being found.

"I like the first minute best." Kaela folded the words around the song. "The first minute of the song unfurled quietly, its opening notes gentle and assured, like sunlight through half-drawn curtains. The guitar strummed in slow, deliberate waves, each chord lingering between us, drawing attention closer and quieting the world beyond the bench. For those sixty seconds the city seemed to pause. The melody leaned in, inviting shared smiles and small promises that this sliver of afternoon belonged just to us."

Joren watched her hands as she folded the paper band into a ring for the bench slat. Her right fingers trembled once. She paused, breathed in for a count, out for two counts, then reset her grip. The tremor eased. He kept his gaze on the flower so she would not feel watched.

"Thank you for not saying anything." Kaela said.

"I saw that you had it." he said simply.

She laughed, small and true. "I like a friend who knows the difference between rescue and respect."

"Good." He looked at her. "I can bring both, but respect arrives first."

They sat with the music. The plant wall breathed. A child ran past with a kite made from a market bag and two sticks. The kite dipped, rose, dipped, and found a glide.

"I want to say something that is just mine." Kaela said. "Not a secret, just something real."

"I am listening." Joren replied.

"I am afraid of being a symbol." she said. "People see my father's job and my mother's illness and my tremor, and they start weaving a story about me that I never asked them to tell. I want to be part of the work without becoming a message."

Joren turned the paper flower in his fingers. "I hear you." he said. "I am not going to put you up on a billboard. I will only ask questions. Besides, I rather prefer having you mostly to myself." He smiled, shy and raw.

"That is sweet. All right, you may ask one question."

"What keeps you moving forward, even on a bad day?"

"My breath. It belongs to me. It is not dramatic. It is steady. I can always count it. When the tremor arrives and is out of my control, my breath is still mine."

Joren nodded. "Mine is a route I draw in my head before my feet move. When the lift is full and the tram is slow and the clerk wants me to wait, I walk the whole errand in my mind first. Then I let my body follow."

Kaela watched the corridor where the lift doors opened and closed like a tide. "You are good at being seventeen."

"I have practiced for almost an entire year. I plan to be even better at eighteen."

A small group of students paused at the plant wall for a photograph. One asked if the paper flowers were for sale. Kaela smiled and said no, then added, "They are not for sale today." leaving room for a different day with a stall and a sign and a jar for coins.

The music softened into a last chord. Joren flicked the player off and set the chip beside the map flowers.

"Tell me one thing you want that is simple."

"Simple." She thought for a breath. "I want to hear a turbine without smelling oil. I want to sit in a seat that looks at a sky and says this belongs to us, even if the sky is a screen."

"I can give you half of that. I cannot lend you the sky, but I can walk you to the hangar overlook. It is loud, yet it feels like purpose instead of a threat. The floor hums in a way that makes your shoulder blades dance with your spine."

Kaela laughed. "You sound like someone who finds comfort in familiar places, as if even the railings and walkways can offer reassurance."

"I do. It is just that the railing said, bring company next time."

A soft tone sounded overhead. The public channel spoke in a neutral voice. "Notice. Procurement briefing at second bell on Deck One. Authorized personnel only. Notice."

Joren glanced at the sealed pouch and made the face of someone who accepts the world's tempo. "That tone means I should not be late. Captain Draeven dislikes it when couriers sprint with paperwork."

"You can walk fast without sprinting. My mother says speed is not a moral category."

"Your mother is wise. I will see you after your last class. If the bench we like is taken, we can find another spot."

"I will bring two more paper flowers then, in case we need to adopt another slat."

Joren stood, then offered his hand as if he were asking permission to help and not assuming it. Kaela took it and rose with a steady motion that pleased her. For a moment, Joren lingered, acutely aware of the warmth and the shape of her fingers in his. The contact felt like a pulse of quiet reassurance, and he savored it, just a breath longer than necessary, before releasing her hand with a small, reluctant delay.

He lifted the pouch, gave her a small salute that felt more like a promise than a performance, and headed toward the corridor that led to the radial lift. His steps were quick and even. The pouch sat balanced on his forearm. He did not look back because he knew she would be watching and he wanted to give her the gift of choosing when to look away.

Kaela watched until he turned the corner. Then she sat and listened to the pumps under the wall until she could hear her own pulse echo the rhythm. She placed the third flower in her satchel, closed the clasp, and rested both hands on the bench. The plant wall smelled like damp stone and green light. She found the breath she liked best, the one that began in her belly and climbed without hurry to the top of her chest, and she said aloud for the wall to keep, "I will be part of the work. I will not be a message. I will be a person doing a job that matters."

A market bell rang from the far end of the commons. The crowd shifted. Somewhere in the bright noise, a baby laughed and learned what echo means. Kaela rose, lifted her satchel, and felt the pleasant weight of paper and slate and music. The tram bell sounded again, two notes up, two notes down. She stepped into the stream of people and let it carry her toward the classroom steps.

"Later that afternoon, at the hangar overlook above Deck One, where turbines warm the air and voices carry like ropes."

The overlook rail held the vibration of engines that waited for orders. Air smelled of oil and heat and the metallic sweet the decontamination team used on floor drains. Below, crew moved with the tidy speed of a well-practiced team. Armor clasps clicked. Net cannons thumped as they locked into racks. A crane swung across a slow arc as it lifted a cage into place.

Kaela set her palms on the rail and felt the hum rise through her bones. Joren came up beside her with a fresh scuff on his sleeve and a grin that had learned restraint in front of officers.

"I walked, and I was still on time. The railing approves."

"It does." Kaela smiled. "It told me you would be back."

On the floor below, Captain Draeven stood with Specialist Hale and two others from the squad. Doctor Elias Tharros spoke with them. Mira Jeylan crossed the hangar with a clipboard and a box of tagged vials. Nyra Solwyn leaned against a crate and watched the far door as if it carried a private signal only she could hear.

The public address voice cleared its throat. "Briefing will begin at second bell. Authorized personnel report to the marked circle."

Joren tipped his chin toward the chalk ring on the floor where the team was gathering. "That is where everyone stands for the briefing. It helps people focus."

Kaela watched her father lift a small speaker and press a button. A low tone moved through the hangar, not loud, just present. It sounded like the Lattice Suite when a model began to behave.

"Listen." Kaela said. "That tone means the team is exactly on target for the capture. The models are aligned and behaving."

"How do you know?"

"I spend enough time in my father's head." She smirked. "By accident and then on purpose. I am surprised he does not charge me rent."

Joren nodded once, as if he had expected that answer and was glad to hear it anyway. "Do you want to stay for the first minutes? We can leave when the doors open. I can walk you to the lift before the launch."

"I want to hear how it starts." A grin flickered across her face. "Beginnings are the best part. They make the rest feel like it might actually turn out all right."

Below, her father spoke in a clear voice that carried without strain. "When a Sunfan beast heats up, the armor opens like a folding fan and pulls into a curve. Pilots, fly along that curve and do not try to fly a straight line. A straight line will shear the capture net. The net couplers hold best when we match the targets path. Our aim is a live capture with low stress"

Captain Draeven nodded and pointed to the cage. "No bravado." he said. "We bring the doctor a healthy specimen for his work, and we bring everyone home."

Specialist Hale checked a tranquilizer array, then looked up toward the overlook. She spotted Kaela and gave a single small nod that felt like recognition as much as comfort. Kaela returned the nod. Joren lifted two fingers in a quiet salute he reserved for people who had earned it.

A warning chime sounded. The big door at the far end of the hangar unsealed with a long breath. The air changed. The floor hum deepened a degree. Kaela felt the hairs rise along her forearms.

"I will walk you to the lift."

"Thank you. I will listen for the turbines when the doors close."

They stepped back from the rail and moved with the crowd that had gathered to watch. Voices rose, fell, rose again. From the corridor the tram bell answered with the same two notes that marked the commons. The ship spoke in chimes, tones, and the low breath of engines. It sounded like a place that believed in work.

At the lift, Joren pressed the call button. The doors opened with a soft sigh. Kaela stepped in and turned to face him.

"Bring me back a story that does not smell like fear."

"I will bring you a story that smells like dust and heat and a net that found the right curve." he said. "I will also find a good bench where I can share it with you."

"I will bring the flowers." She lifted a hand in goodbye as the doors slid shut.

The doors slid closed. The lift whisked Kaela upward toward the school corridor, her silhouette framed for a breath before vanishing. Joren lingered, the gentle sigh of the departing lift echoing in his memory. He let the hum of turbines and distant voices fade into the background; his thoughts caught on the warmth of Kaela's farewell. The promise of stories, the flowers she would bring, the easy way she'd met his gaze.

They were still only friends; at least, that was what the world saw. Yet friendship had become a vessel for something quieter and deeper, a current beneath the spoken words. Joren let himself savor the preciousness of those shared moments: the exchange of small, familiar gestures, the almost-private language of nods and salutes, the way her smile lingered in the air after she'd gone.

He stood at the edge of the hangar, letting the memory of her voice anchor him against the coming unknown. Around him, the team's preparations swelled: a chorus of equipment checks and murmured anticipation. Still, he held onto that fleeting connection, a quiet hope threading through his chest. At last, he turned back toward the chalk circle, the world resuming its rhythm as a nearby turbine cleared its throat and began, once more, to sing.
