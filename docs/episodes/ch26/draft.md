Chapter 26 - The Anvil

Back at the mining base, the Wardens closed on the next gallery with thermals up and rifles low. The corridor bent twice, then opened into a loading bay with carts on rails and a ceiling crane locked in place. Hale swept left. Dax took right. Halden checked the floor plates and called them clear. Joren marked the door frame and kept rear security. Rane's voice stayed steady in their ears: hold shape, confirm targets, capture if possible.

The counterattack came fast. A cart slammed off a rail and skidded across the floor hard enough to throw sparks. A body followed it in a bounding step that covered distance the way a spring covers it: not a run, a series of hard drops that sent weight through the deck. The figure cleared the wreckage and squared to them.

They saw the build first. Chest and shoulders like an ox: thick ribs, heavy trapezius, neck shortened by muscle that had no place to go. The legs carried strange angles. One knee bent the wrong way at rest, then snapped forward into a usable position when he loaded it, so each step landed like a jump. The arms did not match the chest. They were long and thin with old fracture lines that had set badly and then broken again. Bone had healed where it could and given up where it could not. The forearms shook when he changed direction, then locked when he struck.

"The Anvil," Dax said. He did not raise his voice.

The man's face held a calm that did not belong on a body like that. His eyes tracked center mass and then dropped to the muzzle line as if choosing which one to take first. He bounced once on the reversed knee and crossed ten meters in two bounds.

"Less lethal will not hold," Hale said.

"Lethal if necessary," Rane answered. "Stop him."

The Anvil hit the first cart and sent it into the wall. He cut toward Hale with the knee snapping into place just long enough to drive. Hale shifted off line and gave him space. The right arm swung wide and fast, then shivered under its own torque. The hand hit the rack post and left a dent. It would have broken a skull. The arm shook again and stayed attached because some things keep working out of habit.

Halden cut across the gallery to steal The Anvil's angle. He read her step and changed direction mid-bounce. The long arm swung a straight bar at her forearm. She got the plate up but not square. Bone gave with a dull crack that carried through the room. Her hand went slack. She drew it tight to her chest and set her jaw.

"I am up," she said. She shifted to call and rear.

The Anvil snapped the reversed knee and went at Joren next. Joren braced and took the hit rather than give Hale his side. Shoulder to chest. Air left his lungs. He crossed the gallery and hit the wall with a sound you feel in your ribs. He dropped and did not move.

"Rear down," Hale called. "Dax, keep him off me."

Dax drove a disc into the hip. The slug spread and shoved. The Anvil gave a half step, then surged again with that ugly spring and heaved a cart into Hale's line. She sidestepped, muzzle up, keeping shots clean. Frangibles crushed and dumped energy without changing his mind.

"Stuns," Draeven said. "Try it."

Halden snapped an S-Pulse off the deck in front of him. The canister cracked: white flood, hard pressure, and a sharp report that lifted dust and set the racks humming. Their visors dimmed and came back on schedule. The Anvil walked out of the wash without a hitch: no flinch, no pause, eyes flat. "Might as well be paper poppers," Halden said, tucking her broken arm tight and going to her sidearm with the other hand.

Earlier as was his custom, Draeven had mapped every aspect of the room: ceiling crane, low storage office on the left with a narrow doorway and support struts. He needed The Anvil under that low roof where bounce would die and leverage would turn against him.

"Draw him left," he said. "I will show the door. Hale, sell the opening. Dax, make noise on the far side. Halden, hold rear and keep bystanders out."

He moved first, breaking left with a shoulder turned as bait. Hale gave him three quick steps as if she had lost position. The Anvil took the gift and bounded after the closer body. Dax hammered two loud frangibles into a steel post on the opposite wall to sell a retreat; the gallery rang. The Anvil veered, then chose the easy kill and closed.

Draeven slipped through the storage office door with a sharp turn. "Inside," he said.

Hale cut in behind him. The office ceiling sat a full head lower. The lintel took The Anvil high at the clavicle. He did not turn. He went straight through the frame and into the room because wood and thin plate are nothing to a body like that. He made his own door and came in at a bad angle. That was the point. Bad angle meant bad bounce.

"Low ceiling. Take his legs," Draeven said.

Hale put two into the good calf, then walked a short string across the quad to bleed drive. The leg sagged. He kept coming. He tried to hop on the reversed knee. The hop turned into a stumble in the tight air. He threw a long hook at Draeven; the arm tremored under its own load and missed by half a hand.

Draeven did not trade. He stepped in and jammed a shoulder under the joint to lock it, then bounced the head off the door frame twice in quick sequence. No flourish. Just mechanics. The skull met wood. The bounce died. The Anvil grunted, planted the wrong knee, and drove to crush the space.

"Out," Draeven said. "Now."

They spilled back into the gallery to keep lateral room. The Anvil tore the rest of the wall away and followed. He came up on one good leg and one leg pretending to be a spring. Dax met him with a Breach-six disc into the pelvis. It hit, spread, and shoved. He sank an inch and growled from his throat. It was not for them. It was a body forcing itself to stay in the fight.

"Crane," Draeven said. "Put him under it."

Hale backed toward center, showing him her shoulder again. He chased the same picture because predators do not change a working story under pressure. Dax popped the crane lock at the control pillar. The hook hung low over the concrete.

"On me," Hale called.

She crossed under the hook. The Anvil followed and landed with the reversed knee catching late. Timing failed him under the low steel. He threw weight to stay up. Dax dumped the manual release. The hook dropped the last half meter with a hard clank. Hale slid past. The crown of his head met steel, and his next bounce died in his legs.

"Now," Rane said.

Dax fired another disc into the inside of the bad knee to lock it fully wrong. The joint collapsed into its false rest. The Anvil tried to rise on his arms to bull through anyway. One forearm buckled where an old break had never earned the right to be called whole. He still crawled. He did not stop.

"Joren," Hale said, eyes never leaving the target. "Answer."

Nothing from the wall. No motion.

Halden shifted to cover with her good hand, the broken arm tight to her chest. Her eyes cut once toward where Joren lay and came back to the target because training said you hold the threat before you help your own. "Keep him down," she said, calm and clipped. Pain sat in the voice, not in the plan.

"Hold one," Draeven added, eyes on the hook. He was not done. He wanted the chest flat to kill any last spring and to keep a through-and-through from catching the far wall. He hauled the chain down with both hands. The hook bit into back plate. Hale planted a boot on the hip and pushed. The body flattened to the concrete with a sharp breath. Spring gone. Leverage gone.

The Anvil clawed for Hale's ankle. She stepped back and gave Dax the angle. Dax cut a glance to Draeven. Draeven gave one sharp nod. "Finish it."

Dax shouldered the Longcoil. He set the sight where spine meets rib and took a long breath, because his shoulder had started to shake from the earlier hits and he liked his shot clean.

Movement flickered at the far doorway: another holdout with a tool in both hands, eyes wide, deciding whether to charge. Hale leveled and held for a count to avoid a ricochet off the concrete. The figure froze, then backed away and ran.

"Now," Draeven said.

The Longcoil cracked. The round landed where Dax had set it. The Anvil arched once and stopped moving in the way that means the fight has ended and the report has begun.

The gallery did not fall silent. Crane chain clinked under tension. Halden's breath came short as she guarded the perimeter. Hale counted under hers to take her pulse down. The empty spot where Joren should have answered stayed empty.

"Hold," Draeven said. "No one rushes. Dax, safe and clear. Hale, with me to Joren. I will check the breach points. Halden, you have rear and call any movement."

They crossed to the wall. Joren lay on his side with one arm under him and his helmet canted. Hale rolled him with care and kept his head steady. Chest rise: present. Pulse: there, fast and irregular for a few counts, then settling. No response to voice. No obvious bleed.

"He is breathing," Hale said. "No response yet."

Halden keyed the net with her good hand. "Medical bay, standby for a carry. One Warden down with probable concussion and back impact. We will move when secure."

"Copy," came back over comms.

Draeven returned from the storage office with dust on his shoulders. "Two breaches. We hold here or we get flanked."

"We hold," Draeven said. "Set a perimeter. Tag the body. Photo the joint work. Document the wall break and the crane strike. Then we move Joren. The rest can wait."

Halden lifted her chin. "Arm is broken," she said, more for the log than the room. "I can still call."

"That is what I need," Draeven said.

Dax took photos clean and square: knee reversed and pinned, hip line crushed, forearm collapse, wall torn open, crane mark at the crown. Hale set two markers by Joren's boots and helmet, then looked once at the ruin under the hook and away. The body had been built to kill and had done it somewhere else before today. The shape of it said a hand with a kit and a theory had pushed past every warning sign a sane mind would honor.

A relay clicked somewhere down the corridor. Lights did not return. The job was not finished, but this part was. They lifted Joren with care onto a cart that still rolled true and started the slow push toward the exit: Hale on one side, Dax on the other, Draeven walking backward to watch the dark, and Halden calling directions with a broken arm tucked safe against her ribs. Over the net, Rane's voice stayed steady as she cleared their route and staged the handoff at the door.
