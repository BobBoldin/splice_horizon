Chapter 08 -- Article 12

"Late night in the secure council room off Command, where the lights are low and a white noise unit softens the air."

A narrow table ran the length of the room. The walls held sound and gave nothing back. Commander Aric Veynar sat at the head with a plain folder and an empty mug. To his right, Councillor Hollis Venner kept a thick binder shut under one palm. To his left, Councillor Kaldor Mirea held a small notepad and a blunt pencil. The Clerk of Record, Evan Trusell, waited by a console with the record light dark.

Veynar nodded to the Clerk and said, "Seal the room."

Trusell keyed the panel and said, "Sealed. No public record. Minutes on paper only."

A secure chime sounded. The wall display lit with the upper body of Director Amaris Colvern, liaison for the military sponsor. Her badge sat sharp against a dark jacket.

Colvern said, "Commander. Councillors. Thank you for making the hour."

Veynar kept it tight. "We have first-landing at first light. Say what you need."

Colvern did not waste time. "The sponsor expects performance class specimens. Strength. Speed. Stamina. Resiliency. We want tissue that can carry load and recover. We would prefer live capture. Failing that, fresh samples with clear markers."

Venner lifted two fingers and said, "Article Twelve is active. Non-Weaponization. No field deployment of splices. No weapon kits on the ground. Any exception requires an emergency override in open session. We do not do that in a sealed room."

Colvern's mouth thinned. "I am not asking you to break your book. I am asking you to prepare to meet sponsor needs. Bring back something we can test."

Mirea kept her voice low and said, "First hour is safety and reconnaissance. If we load capture gear, we slow the team and raise risk. We can carry air checks, touch plates, and small pods. No cages. No chutes. If the ground is kind, we will return for a broader kit."

A pen tapped once on Colvern's desk. "Funding is not a sunrise. It is a schedule. I need to tell my side that the Meridian is aligned."

Veynar worked his jaw once and let it ease. "We will not turn our first walk into a hunt. You will get air, water, soil, and stone. If we see shed material, we will take a clean scrape. If we find a print or a scale on a rock, we will lift it. No live capture. Not today."

Colvern pressed again. "The sponsor will expect more than dust and hope."

Venner answered before Veynar could. "If you want live capture on day one, you will force an override. That vote is public by Charter. You will not like how it sounds when we read it to a room that remembers our last neutralization."

A breath later, Colvern sat back a fraction and said, "Then draft contingency language. If the field presents a low-risk opportunity to collect a small live specimen that clearly meets the performance markers, I want you ready to move."

Mirea looked to Veynar and said, "Low-risk in a new sky is a story people tell themselves. I will not hang that on my team."

Veynar opened the plain folder. A printed memo with a red seal sat inside. He did not touch it. "Here is what I can support. We will pre-write a narrow motion for Council review after first-landing. Scope: passive collection only, to include shed tissue, cast-off plate, pollen, spores, hair, and scat. No live capture. Time limit: one day. Any further step waits for an open vote."

Colvern held his eyes. "This will read as foot dragging."

"This will read as the Meridian staying alive."

Venner drew the binder closer and said, "I will draft the motion. Title it Contingency for Passive Biological Collection. I will lock the language so no one stretches it in the hall."

Trusell raised his pen and said, "Paper minutes only. Filed to sealed pouch."

Colvern tried one more angle. "If the team encounters a small, non-aggressive vertebrate or invertebrate with visible endurance traits, can the Commander exercise discretion?"

Venner reiterated, "No."

Mirea gave her own emphatic, "No."

Veynar took the weight and said, "Not without a vote. Director, we need the day to be simple. Give me that, and I will bring you data that does not blow back."

For a second, Colvern looked past the camera. When she returned, she said, "Very well. You will receive a sponsor note stating expectations and acknowledging Article Twelve. I will flag my board that you are drafting a contingency. I will expect a timetable by nightfall tomorrow."

Veynar kept his ground. "You will get a timetable. Not a trophy."

The channel clicked and went dark.

Silence held for a count of four.

Mirea exhaled. "If she had pushed harder, we would be in a public session right now."

"She did not push because she wants the outcome without the record," Venner said.

A thumb ran along the folder's edge before Veynar closed it. "We give her a path that does not break our rule. We keep the team light. We bring back truth we can stand behind."

Trusell waited for the order. "Commander, record?"

"Paper only. Note the sponsor request, our reply, and the draft order. No adjectives. No color."

"Understood." Trusell set to writing in a clean, even hand.

Veynar stood. The room felt smaller than when he had sat down. "Councillors, thank you. We will brief Draeven at first bell. If the sponsor escalates, we move to an open vote. Until then, first-landing stays what we said it would be."

Mirea capped her pencil. "I will tell Procurement to leave the cages on the rack."

Venner closed his binder. "And I will keep the motion in my pocket. I hope I do not need to read it."

They filed out. The seal light over the door shifted from red to amber. In the hall, the ship's ordinary hum returned, steady and familiar, as if to remind them that morning was coming whether anyone liked the politics or not.

"Pre-dawn on Procurement Deck Two, where the bay lights sit low and the Wayfarer waits with its mouth open."

A locker door slid aside. Dax Morlin stood in front of a foam-lined case the size of a travel trunk. He wore a plain gray vest with a narrow tools band and a quiet pride that did not need words. Inside the case, the weapons pack lay in ordered rows: sidearms to the left, a compact carbine broken on two pins to the right, small cylinders in a padded well, and magazines seated like careful teeth.

Captain Draeven watched from the chalk circle and said, "Brief the carry. Keep it simple."

Morlin rested his palms on the case and said, "Here is what you have. Sidearm, carbine, and two non-lethal stun grenades. Article Twelve is live. No splice weapons, no field hacks. These are standard ship arms."

Morlin lifted the first pistol to the light. "This is the M three coil sidearm," he said. "Ten round magazine. Frangible slugs. The barrel is a fixed coil, so there is no slide to bite fingers. The grip is biometric. Your glove lace will key it to your palm. If it is not your gun, it will read dead. The safety band shows amber for safe, red for live. You do not see red unless I say live."

Halden stepped close. "What is the recoil like?"

"Light," Morlin said. "You will feel a hum and a push. The hum means the coil is cycling. Do not ride the trigger. Press, release. The holster rides chest or thigh. I recommend chest for harness clearance. Lanyard clips here. If you drop it, it stays yours."

He placed the pistol in Halden's hands. Weight and balance met her grip; one quiet nod answered.

A second pistol came up. "Same make," he said, offering it to Dax Rovell. "Your mags seat nose forward. Listen for the click. Do not slam."

Rovell seated a magazine with the right amount of push. The click was clean.

Sidearms for the others followed. "You will each carry a sidearm," Morlin said to Nyra Solwyn and Renn Afolu. "Holstered, on safe. If you do not draw, that will be a good day. If you do, you will point only where your eyes are willing to sign."

Nyra clipped the lanyard without ceremony. "Understood."

Renn accepted his with a steady hand. "Also understood."

The carbine came out in two parts. "This is the C nine coil carbine," Morlin said. "Fold stock. Twenty round magazine. Optic has clear glass and low light. Selector is safe, single. There is no burst. If I hear a rapid cadence, I will know you are hurrying. Do not hurry. The muzzle has a baffle cap to take the bite off the coil note. It is not a silencer. It keeps the suit mics from clipping."

Pins aligned with a practiced snap. Stock locked. Shoulder set. The optic winked alive with a thin green dot. "Rifle rides the rack on the lander," he said. "You only take it down on an order."

Draeven answered with a small nod. "Rifles stay on the rack. Pistols holstered, on safe. You will not wave anything at the horizon to feel tall."

Two short cylinders came up from the padded well. "Non-lethal stun grenades," Morlin said. "S pulse model. They give you a flash and a pressure slap that will steal a body's balance without punching holes in a wall. Fuse is two seconds from twist and pull. Decibels are capped under suit limits, but you will still feel it. Do not throw in the lander. Do not throw against your own people. Aim low, center of space. Let the light do the work. Two only. They live in this pouch on the door."

Mira lifted her small case. "Effect on suit systems," she asked. "I do not want a pulse to stun my med kit."

"Rated safe for our suits," Morlin said. "Your vitals will blip. Your ears will swear at you. Your kit will not brick. If you are close to one, turn your head and half close your eyes. You will still see enough."

The lid took a tap. "All of this is cleaned and zeroed. Magazines are full. Spare mags live in this flap. You have two for each sidearm and two for the carbine. If any of you finish a magazine and feel the itch to top off right away, stop and breathe. You will not be in a hallway fight. You will be under a wide sky. Think before you feed."

Tiny brass tags went palm to palm. "Biometric sync," he said. "Press this to the grip. Ten seconds. It will learn your glove today. You change gloves, you touch again."

Nyra touched the tag to the pistol grip. The band flashed amber, then settled.

"Draw and reholster," Morlin said to Halden.

One smooth draw to low ready, one blind re-seat into the chest rig. The motion stayed quiet and honest.

"Good," he said, then watched Rovell repeat it, then Nyra, then Renn. A thumb shifted here, a wrist there, guided by two fingers and a short word.

Draeven set the frame for the hour. "Guns stay on safe. Halden carries point. Rovell runs the ramp and keeps his head out of the optic unless told. Nyra looks and listens. Renn marks soil and stone. Mira watches people. If a draw is called, only Halden draws. If she says holster, you holster. If she says drop, you drop. No one argues the word on the ground."

Rovell raised a hand. "What is the cue for rifles off the rack?"

"You will hear it," Draeven said. "It will be plain."

The case buckled shut. "One last thing," Morlin said. "Frangible slugs behave in flesh and in soft ground. They do not ricochet the way old metal did. They break up fast. That keeps your team safer. It also means your effective range is short. Thirty meters and in. If you cannot count the lines on a leaf, you are too far. You are not sniping. You are making space to back up."

Mira's glance returned to the cylinders. "If someone panics and throws a stun close," she said, "I will manage the bodies after. You keep the order now."

"I will," Morlin said.

A thin cloth roll went to Halden. "Spare seals and a cleaning strip. If dust cakes your gear, strip, pull, oil. Two minutes, not ten."

"Thank you," Halden said, tucking it into her vest.

Veynar stepped into the bay long enough to take the room's measure. "Article Twelve holds. No field splices. Standard arms only. You will not go looking for a fight. If a fight looks for you, you will make space and come home."

"Understood," Draeven said.

"Understood," the team echoed.

One flat slap on the case marked the end. "Keys stay on me," Morlin said. "Ask for a swap. I will be at the rail with the second team. Come back with a story about a gun saving your day, and I will listen. Come back and say you never touched it, and I will sleep better."

Rovell let a grin show and stop where it should. "I plan to sleep better."

"Keep it that way."

They moved to the suit racks. Latches clicked. Fabric whispered. Holsters settled under harness straps. The Wayfarer's ramp light shifted from red to amber. The bay smelled of clean metal and a thin line of machine oil from Morlin's cloth.

Nyra weighed pistols, then Mira's sample pods, then the empty space between. "We will walk. We will look before we touch."

"Good," Halden said, catching each safety with one glance. Amber all around.

The ramp light waited at amber for morning to arrive.
