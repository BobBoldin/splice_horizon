Chapter 08 -- Article 12

"Late night in the secure council room off Command, where the lights are low and a white noise unit softens the air."

A narrow table ran the length of the room. The walls held sound and gave nothing back. **Commander Aric Veynar** sat at the head with a plain folder and an empty mug. To his right, **Councillor Hollis Venner** kept a thick binder shut under one palm. To his left, **Councillor Kaldor Mirea** had a small notepad and a blunt pencil. The **Clerk of Record**, **Evan Trusell**, waited by a console with the record light dark.

Veynar nodded to the Clerk. "Seal the room," he said.

Trusell keyed the panel. "Sealed," he said. "No public record. Minutes on paper only."

A secure channel chimed. The wall display lit with the upper body of **Director Amaris Colvern**, liaison for the military sponsor. Her badge sat sharp against a dark jacket.

"Commander," Colvern said. "Councillors. Thank you for making the hour."

"We have first-landing at first light," Veynar said. "Say what you need."

Colvern did not waste time. "The sponsor expects performance class specimens," she said. "Strength. Speed. Stamina. Resiliency. We want tissue that can carry load and recover. We would prefer live capture. Failing that, fresh samples with clear markers."

Venner lifted two fingers. "Article Twelve is active," he said. "Non-Weaponization. No field deployment of splices. No weapon kits on the ground. Any exception requires an emergency override in open session. We do not do that in a sealed room."

Colvern's mouth thinned. "I am not asking you to break your book," she said. "I am asking you to **prepare** to meet sponsor needs. Bring back something we can test."

Mirea kept her voice low. "First hour is safety and reconnaissance," she said. "If we load capture gear, we slow the team and raise risk. We can carry air checks, touch plates, and small pods. No cages. No chutes. If the ground is kind, we will return for a broader kit."

Colvern tapped a pen on her desk, once. "Funding is not a sunrise," she said. "It is a schedule. I need to tell my side that the Meridian is aligned."

Veynar's jaw worked once and eased. "We will not turn our first walk into a hunt," he said. "You will get air, water, soil, and stone. If we see shed material, we will take a clean scrape. If we find a print or a scale on a rock, we will lift it. No live capture. Not today."

"Commander," Colvern said, "the sponsor will expect more than dust and hope."

"Director," Venner said, "if you want live capture on day one, you will force an override. That vote is public by Charter. You will not like how it sounds when we read it to a room that remembers our last neutralization."

Colvern sat back a fraction. "Then draft contingency language," she said. "If the field presents a low-risk opportunity to collect a small live specimen that clearly meets the performance markers, I want you ready to move."

Mirea looked to Veynar. "Low-risk in a new sky is a story people tell themselves," she said. "I will not hang that on my team."

Veynar opened the plain folder. Inside sat a printed memo with a red seal. He did not touch it. "Here is what I can support," he said. "We will pre-write a narrow motion for Council review **after** first-landing. Scope: passive collection only, to include shed tissue, cast-off plate, pollen, spores, hair, and scat. No live capture. Time limit: one day. Any further step waits for an open vote."

Colvern held his eyes. "This will read as foot dragging," she said.

"This will read as the Meridian staying alive," Veynar said.

Venner drew the binder closer. "I will draft the motion," he said. "Title it Contingency for Passive Biological Collection. I will lock the language so no one stretches it in the hall."

Trusell raised his pen. "Paper minutes only," he said. "Filed to sealed pouch."

Colvern tried one more angle. "If the team encounters a small, non-aggressive vertebrate or invertebrate with visible endurance traits, can the Commander exercise discretion."

"No," Venner said.

"No," Mirea said.

Veynar took the weight of it. "Not without a vote," he said. "Director, we need the day to be simple. Give me that, and I will bring you data that does not blow back."

Colvern looked past the camera for a second, then returned. "Very well," she said. "You will receive a sponsor note stating expectations and acknowledging Article Twelve. I will flag my board that you are drafting a contingency. I will expect a timetable by nightfall tomorrow."

"You will get a timetable," Veynar said. "Not a trophy."

The channel clicked and went dark.

Silence held for a count of four.

Mirea exhaled. "If she had pushed harder," she said, "we would be in a public session right now."

"Which is why she did not push," Venner said. "She wants the outcome without the record."

Veynar rubbed a thumb along the edge of the folder and closed it. "We give her a path that does not break our rule," he said. "We keep the team light. We bring back truth we can stand behind."

Trusell waited. "Commander," he said, "record?"

"Paper only," Veynar said. "Note the sponsor request, our reply, and the draft order. No adjectives. No color."

"Understood," Trusell said, and began to write in a clean, even hand.

Veynar stood. The room seemed smaller than when he had sat down. "Councillors, thank you," he said. "We will brief Draeven at first bell. If the sponsor escalates, we move to an open vote. Until then, first-landing stays what we said it would be."

Mirea capped her pencil. "I will tell Procurement to leave the cages on the rack," she said.

Venner closed his binder. "And I will keep the motion in my pocket," he said. "I hope I do not need to read it."

They filed out. The seal light over the door shifted from red to amber. In the hall, the ship's ordinary hum returned, steady and familiar, as if to remind them that morning was coming whether anyone liked the politics or not.

"Pre-dawn on Procurement Deck Two, where the bay lights sit low and the Wayfarer waits with its mouth open."

A locker door slid aside. **Dax Morlin** stood in front of a foam-lined case the size of a travel trunk. He wore a plain gray vest with a narrow tools band and a quiet pride that did not need words. Inside the case, the **weapons pack** lay in ordered rows: sidearms to the left, a compact carbine broken on two pins to the right, small cylinders in a padded well, and magazines seated like careful teeth.

Captain Draeven watched from the chalk circle. "Brief the carry," he said. "Keep it simple."

Morlin rested his palms on the case. "Here is what you have," he said. "Sidearm, carbine, and two non-lethal stun grenades. Article Twelve is live. No splice weapons, no field hacks. These are standard ship arms."

He lifted the first pistol to the light. "This is the M three coil sidearm," he said. "Ten round magazine. Frangible slugs. The barrel is a fixed coil, so there is no slide to bite fingers. The grip is biometric. Your glove lace will key it to your palm. If it is not your gun, it will read dead. The safety band shows amber for safe, red for live. You do not see red unless I say live."

Halden stepped close. "Recoil," she asked.

"Light," Morlin said. "You will feel a hum and a push. The hum means the coil is cycling. Do not ride the trigger. Press, release. The holster rides chest or thigh. I recommend chest for harness clearance. Lanyard clips here. If you drop it, it stays yours."

He set the pistol in Halden's hands. She checked weight and balance and nodded once.

Morlin lifted the second pistol. "Same make," he said, and offered it to **Dax Rovell**. "Your mags seat nose forward. Listen for the click. Do not slam."

Rovell seated a magazine with the right amount of push. The click was clean.

Morlin turned to **Nyra Solwyn** and **Renn Afolu**. "You will each carry a sidearm," he said. "Holstered, on safe. If you do not draw, that will be a good day. If you do, you will point only where your eyes are willing to sign."

Nyra took hers and clipped the lanyard without ceremony. "Understood," she said.

Renn accepted his with a steady hand. "Understood," he echoed.

Morlin reached for the carbine. "This is the C nine coil carbine," he said. "Fold stock. Twenty round magazine. Optic has clear glass and low light. Selector is safe, single. There is no burst. If I hear a rapid cadence, I will know you are hurrying. Do not hurry. The muzzle has a baffle cap to take the bite off the coil note. It is not a silencer. It just keeps the suit mics from clipping."

He pinned the carbine together in one smooth motion, locked the stock, and shouldered it. The optic winked alive with a thin green dot. "Rifle rides the rack on the lander," he said. "You only take it down on an order."

Draeven gave a small nod. "Rifles stay on the rack," he said. "Pistols holstered, on safe. You will not wave anything at the horizon to feel tall."

Morlin lifted two short cylinders from the padded well. "Non-lethal stun grenades," he said. "S pulse model. They give you a flash and a pressure slap that will steal a body's balance without punching holes in a wall. Fuse is two seconds from twist and pull. Decibels are capped under suit limits, but you will still feel it. Do not throw in the lander. Do not throw against your own people. Aim low, center of space. Let the light do the work. Two only. They live in this pouch on the door."

Mira stepped in with her small case. "Effect on suit systems," she asked. "I do not want a pulse to stun my med kit."

"Rated safe for our suits," Morlin said. "Your vitals will blip. Your ears will swear at you. Your kit will not brick. If you are close to one, turn your head and half close your eyes. You will still see enough."

He set the grenades back and tapped the lid. "All of this is cleaned and zeroed," he said. "Magazines are full. Spare mags live in this flap. You have two for each sidearm and two for the carbine. If any of you finish a magazine and feel the itch to top off right away, stop and breathe. You will not be in a hallway fight. You will be under a wide sky. Think before you feed."

He passed out a tiny brass tag to each of them. "Biometric sync," he said. "Press this to the grip. Ten seconds. It will learn your glove today. You change gloves, you touch again."

Nyra pressed her tag to the pistol grip. The band flashed amber, then settled.

Morlin looked to Halden. "Draw and reholster," he said.

Halden drew once, straight out and down to low ready, then seated the pistol back into the chest rig without looking. The motion was quiet and honest.

"Good," Morlin said. He watched Rovell repeat it, then Nyra, then Renn. He corrected a thumb here, a wrist there, with two fingers and a short word.

Draeven set the frame. "Rules for the hour," he said. "Guns stay on safe. Halden carries point. Rovell runs the ramp and keeps his head out of the optic unless told. Nyra looks and listens. Renn marks soil and stone. Mira watches people. If a draw is called, only Halden draws. If she says holster, you holster. If she says drop, you drop. No one argues the word on the ground."

Rovell raised a hand. "What is the cue for rifles off the rack," he asked.

"You will hear it," Draeven said. "It will be plain."

Morlin closed the case and buckled the lid. "One last thing," he said. "Frangible slugs behave in flesh and in soft ground. They do not ricochet the way old metal did. They break up fast. That keeps your team safer. It also means your effective range is short. Thirty meters and in. If you cannot count the lines on a leaf, you are too far. You are not sniping. You are making space to back up."

Mira glanced at the small cylinders again. "If someone panics and throws a stun close," she said, "I will manage the bodies after. You keep the order now."

"I will," Morlin said.

He handed Halden a thin cloth roll. "Spare seals and a cleaning strip," he said. "If dust cakes your gear, strip, pull, oil. Two minutes, not ten."

Halden tucked it into her vest. "Thank you," she said.

Veynar stepped into the bay long enough to stand in the doorway and weigh the room. "Article Twelve holds," he said. "No field splices. Standard arms only. You will not go looking for a fight. If a fight looks for you, you will make space and come home."

"Understood," Draeven said.

"Understood," the team echoed.

Morlin slapped the case once, not for drama, just to mark the end. "Keys stay on me. Ask for a swap. I will be at the rail with the second team. Come back with a story about a gun saving your day, and I will listen. Come back and say you never touched it, and I will sleep better."

Rovell grinned and let it stop where it should. "I plan to sleep better," he said.

"Keep it that way," Morlin said.

They moved to the suit racks. Latches clicked. Fabric whispered. Holsters settled under harness straps. The Wayfarer's ramp light went from red to amber. The bay smelled like clean metal and a little machine oil from Morlin's cloth.

Nyra looked once at the pistols, then at the sample pods in Mira's case, and then at the empty space between. "We will walk," she said. "We will look before we touch."

"Good," Halden said. She checked each of their safeties with one glance. Amber all around.

The ramp light stayed at amber and waited for the morning to catch up.
