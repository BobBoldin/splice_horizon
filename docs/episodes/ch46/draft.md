Chapter 46 --- The Long Lap

The first week lived inside the medical bay with quiet counts and honest work. Anchors settled where bone meets will. Joren learned the new rhythm, the way you learn a shop tool: hands first, mind half a beat later, pride somewhere in the back taking notes. He walked ten steps with the brace, then twenty, then thirty with a light hand on the rail because patience turns ten into thirty faster than bravado ever did. The panel rode at his right like a level on a carpenter's belt. Green held. Amber flirted and then respected the schedule.

Kaela kept the chair at his left and matched his breath when the line tightened. Her hand rested on his forearm with a pressure that told him she tracked his pace and his mood and had room for both. When the nurse checked cuffs and numbers, Kaela read the same screens and let the calm in her face walk across to his chest. Elias stood near the foot of the bed with a clipboard and the kind of careful attention Joren had grown to trust. He reviewed the counts, asked two clean questions, and nodded once when the answers carried weight.

Day four brought the first lap inside the room. Ten steps forward. Pause. Ten steps back. The anchors felt like firm hands at the shins and knees. The tendon suite along the hips felt like a good harness, tight where needed, natural at rest. Balance lives in the small muscles that never ask for applause, so he gave them steady hours and straightforward food. The journal he kept on the tray recorded simple facts: steps, breath, color under the nails, one line about how hope sat in his chest like a weight that finally wanted lifting.

Week two moved beyond the doorway into the corridor with its even light and familiar rail marks. Hale stood at the midpoint and counted the lines with him. She walked backwards and talked about hand placement when the body wants to swing for speed. "Keep the elbows quiet," she advised, voice low and warm. "Let the hips do their work. Bring your eyes where your feet plan to go." He did and the world obeyed. Dax joined two days later with a small pack he called a "friendly truth." Ten pounds went on his back and stayed there for a short lap. Breath rose, then steadied. The panel gave him green again. Ten pounds became fifteen. Fifteen became twenty. He held each number until his stride lived clean.

Kaela found him a habit that pleased both of them. After each corridor lap she handed him a bottle and touched two fingers to the place where the anchor rode on his forearm. "Here," she murmured. "You earn with this and you carry with this." The touch traveled through skin and metal and bone. He carried the feeling into sleep.

By midweek the brace left his leg for good. The nurse cleared it with two signatures and a look at his posture. The corridor welcomed him like an old job given back to the person who had done it right. He put one lap in the book and felt something strong tighten behind his ribs in a way that felt like gratitude and hunger together. He slept deep that night and woke before the alarm with legs that wanted another count.

Week three carried him up a flight of stairs with the light pack and down again with a pace he respected. Rane walked the landing and watched his heel place and toe push. "Smooth at the turn," she observed. "Keep eyes up. Make the rail optional by choice, not by fear." He kept the rail optional and made a second pass with a steadier knee. The anchor suite rewarded clean mechanics with a feeling he had missed for too long: leg bones carrying load as if they signed up for it.

The jog began in short intervals: thirty seconds up, ninety seconds walk, repeat for eight rounds. The panel tracked his balance line as a little ball inside two thin rails, and the ball stayed centered. Sweat found its path at the temples and along his back. Kaela walked alongside and counted the rounds under her breath. She called the last one with a grin that reached her eyes. He answered with a grin of his own because hope and effort taste better when someone shares them.

Elias increased the load once more at the end of week three. The pack climbed to thirty-five pounds and his stride adjusted without drama. Hips accepted transfer. Knees kept their quiet promise. Ankles checked in like diligent workers and then faded into the job. The the body's sense of where its parts are and how they're moving line whispered through the spine and kept the head steady over the feet. He finished the session with a simple stretch and a plate of food that smelled like heat and salt at the right time of day.

He added a small ritual in those days. After each workout he walked to the small workshop near the training hall where Dax kept odds and ends, and he filed a simple ring cut from a ship-grade strip he had traded from a friendly machinist. He rounded the edges with patience. He sanded the inside until it felt like a truth he could carry without thinking about it. He etched three short marks on the outside where a jeweler might put flourishes. He chose the rail marks from the corridor as his pattern because promises live better when they carry a place inside them.

Week four carried real distance. The corridor laps turned into a mapping of two decks and a loop near a view port where stars sat like rivets in a black plate. The pack reached fifty pounds at the start of the week and slid to sixty by midweek. He jogged the first half of the loop and walked the second, then reversed the order the next day to keep his head honest. Hale joined one run and taught him where to shave a corner without losing control. Dax joined the next and counted his cadence in a quiet rhythm that filled the air with simple numbers. Kaela met him at the finish with water and a towel and a kiss to the cheek that warmed the rest of the hour.

On day twenty-six, Rane stood at the doorway of the medical bay with a sheet in her hand and a small, rare smile that belonged to completed work. "Fit-for-duty check sits on the table," she informed him. "You bring legs and lungs. We bring a stopwatch and a clipboard. We keep it clean and fair."

He brought both. The test lived in three parts: a two-kilometer jog at an honest clip with the hundred-pound pack, a stair climb and descent with smooth landings, and a final carry of a two-hundred pound weighted dummy across the training floor without a hitch. He placed each piece where it belonged and gave it only what it earned. The panel liked his counts. The stopwatch wrote numbers that matched the standard. The clipboard carried two signatures by the end.

"Cleared for progressive return," Rane concluded, voice even. "We place you on the board for light duty this week and full duty next week. You brief with me each shift, not because I doubt you, but because leaders buy their insight with time."

He met her eyes and let the gratitude show without turning it into a speech. "Understood," he replied. "I plan to pay that bill."

Three days later, he set his plan in the corridor he had promised himself. The ship clock read late afternoon. The light across the ceiling fell into a familiar pattern he had watched as a patient and now watched as a man who could claim momentum again. He strapped a twenty-pound pack for symbolism rather than strain. He walked to the start of the long lap, set both feet square, and lifted his chin.

Kaela waited at the first turn with a smile that looked like shared endurance rather than triumph. She wore the jacket he liked, the one with the elbow patches she claimed were for notes but which he knew were for the way she leans when she gets lost in a thought. She held a small cloth in one hand and her slate in the other. Elias stood twenty steps behind her with his hands behind his back and that careful look that fits a father and a physician. Liora arrived a minute later, breath a little quick from the pace she preferred, eyes bright. Rane leaned in the doorway farther down, pretending to check a panel that did not need checking, which counted as giving a person space and keeping promises all at once.

Joren took the first steps with a steady cadence. He counted rail marks inside his chest the way he had counted time when he wore braces and practiced patience. Ten marks went by. Twenty. Thirty. Breath warmed his throat and moved clean. The pack sat on his shoulders like an honest weight that belonged with him. He kept his eyes up and his pace even and let the moment carry work rather than drama.

At the halfway point he slowed to a walk and drew a long breath through his nose because a person earns pride by keeping form. Kaela fell in beside him and matched her stride to his. She did not touch his arm. She let the respect show in the space she kept and the rhythm she held.

"You move like yourself," she offered, voice low.

"I feel like myself," he returned. "With better parts where it counts."

"That version fits," she replied. "I plan to keep up."

He smiled at that and checked the last corner with a small head turn. The final run stretched before him like the kind of job you hold in your hands and finish with craft. He shifted to a jog, counted six strides, and then let his body do the rest of the count because bodies deserve that much trust after a month like this. The rail marks passed under his eyes with a familiarity that sat right with him. The anchor suite in his legs sang quiet, steady notes that he would recognize for the rest of his life.

He crossed the finish line he had chosen for himself and came to a smooth stop, hands on hips, breath deep and measured. Kaela stepped in close then and placed her palm against his cheek. He leaned into it for one second because he had earned that second.

"Walk with me," he invited, breath easing.

"Yes," she agreed, and they took ten slow steps together while his heart eased and the world wrote itself into a shape he could carry.

He had planned the next part during late nights at the workbench with Dax's files and Hale's jokes drifting in memory, and with his own promises sitting like a weight he liked to pick up. He set the pack down at the wall, reached into the front pocket, and brought out the ring that felt like the corridor under his fingers. Ship-grade alloy. Edges rounded to the comfort he had wanted her to feel. Three tiny etches at the band: the spacing of the marks on this very stretch, cut with a steady hand and a patient mind.

He stayed standing because standing meant more than kneeling to him after this month. He held the ring in his palm with fingers open so the light could make the simple metal honest and not theatrical. He found her eyes and kept them.

"I came here with braces and a promise," he began, voice steady, cadence plain. "I told myself I would carry my life on my own legs before I asked you to carry it with me. The ship gave me anchors. Work gave me breath. You gave me a reason to count past ten. I would like our days to share one ledger. I want this ring on your hand and your name next to mine when the ship writes rosters and when the years write stories."

Her eyes filled and cleared in the same breath because she holds herself like a person who respects strong feelings and also respects steady words. She lifted her left hand without looking away from him. He placed the ring there and felt heat and cool and something that had nothing to do with temperature move through his chest.

"Yes," she answered, plain and full. "Yes to the ledger and the rosters and the stories. Yes to this table and to the tables we will build in rooms that have not been cut yet."

He drew her in then and kissed her once, not for show, but because the corridor had held every part of his work for a month and deserved this part, too. When they parted, she laughed through her nose and wiped one corner of her eye with the back of her free hand.

Liora walked the last steps at a pace that matched the moment. She touched Joren's shoulder with a grip that carried pride. "We eat," she proposed, because celebrations live better with food and family.

Elias stood close enough to be a witness and far enough to keep the room from turning into a clinic. He offered his hand and Joren took it. The pressure met like folk who have carried fear for the same person and now choose joy with the same care. "You earned this," Elias offered. "You kept your counts. You kept your promises."

Rane cleared her throat softly from the doorway and gave the smallest nod a leader gives when her people bring a hard thing home. She did not intrude. She would, later, ask for the time and the place of the ceremony in a tone that invited logistics rather than emotion, which was how she honors affection in her house.

They walked together toward the mess. The corridor light warmed and the rail marks lost their hold because the job for the day had finished. Joren moved with an ease that belonged to him now. Kaela tucked her arm through his and rested her fingers inside his elbow. The ring felt snug and right against her skin. He could not stop glancing at it, which made her laugh and bump his hip.

Dinner turned into a small party because good news travels on swift feet. Hale arrived with a grin and a story about bean bags and reflexes that made Liora bark a laugh. Dax brought a roll of paper and unrolled a simple drawing of a small table with joined angles that would live in their quarters. "Wedding gift in progress," he announced. "Strong joinery. No wobbles. I will take payment in dessert."

"Two desserts," Kaela countered, and the bargain closed with a handshake.

Later, in the quiet near the view port where the stars sat like clean fasteners, Kaela leaned against him and rested her head on his shoulder. The ship hummed with the kind of calm that follows work well done. He felt the anchors in his legs and the ring in her hand and the simple weight of the future in front of them.

She lifted her face and smiled at him in a way that placed warmth in his chest and humor on his tongue. "You carried that pack for an hour this morning," she teased, voice low. "You kept your pace tonight through the long lap. I plan to test this new found stamina of yours on our wedding night with the kind of enthusiasm that makes neighbors gossip."

He laughed and let the sound live there for a full breath. "I plan to show up ready, willing, and eager," he answered. "You bring your passion. I will bring mine."

"Done," she replied, eyes bright. "\"We set our own pace and make sure every moment glows because it's ours to celebrate.\"

They stood there a while and watched the view port hold its patient sky. The month had asked for steadiness. The day had offered return. The ring felt warm under her thumb. The anchors felt like part of him rather than tools borrowed for a time. He carried the quiet like a second gift, then walked her home along the corridor where he had promised himself a life and now found it ready to begin.
