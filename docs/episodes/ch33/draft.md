Chapter 33 --- Backtrail

The Wardens worked the ship in quiet shoes and clean light because noise turns into warning when you hunt a clever opponent. Draeven took point through a service corridor where patch plates met old paint with a seam that told the truth about dates, and Hale walked offset with a slate that logged each mark they chose to honor. Dax carried the kit that lifted residue without smearing a story, and Halden kept the channel up from a chair in the operations room with her forearm in a splint and her other hand steady on the keys.

They started with what they could touch. A door frame on Level C wore a faded triangle where a sticker had once guarded a toolbox, and the glue shadow matched the brand that had traveled with the last batch of couplers. Hale held the lamp low and angled the beam until the gloss showed a shape, Dax took a sample with a thin card and a measured pull, and Draeven logged the location with a depth mark and a time. No speeches, only the work and the next step laid out with a small nod.

"Battery scoring here," Hale observed, pointing at a scuffed shelf where a pack had rocked under a hurried hand. "Three scratches in a row with equal spacing, and the angle reads the same as the field kit we seized last week."

"Copy for pattern," Halden answered over the net, her tone calm enough to hold a room. "I am building a layer for that spacing so we can search it in photos."

They moved on to a tool cart with one missing wheel and two new bolts that did not belong, and Dax checked the threads because some mechanics keep spare parts where couriers like to hide devices. The bolts came out clean, but the tray under the top shelf carried a line of gray dust that held a narrow groove. A cable once sat there with a clamp at one end and a habit of rolling when hands worked fast, and the width matched a coupler lead.

Draeven looked up the corridor and saw the ship by its arteries rather than its skin. "This is one path," he noted, not to fill air but to mark the thought where others could refine it. "Inventory moves through here because the locks are old and the watch is light on double shift."

Hale drew a small map on her slate with three lines that met at a hatch to the service trunk. "Another path cuts through the laundry deck because the carts mask sound and cameras face the doorway," she added, her voice even and precise. "A third path likely uses the food waste lift because it runs on a schedule no one respects."

"Mark all three for route checks," Halden returned. "I will pull footage by angle and time, and I will flag any cart that breaks cadence."

They took the stairwell to the storage deck. Air ran dry across the tongue and left a faint coolant tang at the back of the throat. Strip lights pooled on the bins and picked out fine scuffs along the walk path. A slow vibration came through the grating from the fans below and made tool trays rattle a little. The room felt used and orderly, with new fittings stacked straight and log cards clipped square.

The count ran long because a count that matters never asks to hurry. Three more empty slots emerged with no pulls on record, and two boxes carried serial corners torn away to defeat a scan. Halden logged the serial range and cross-referenced the receiving invoices while her cursor drifted across the screen like a careful hand she could trust. She found five crates from a low-volume vendor with delivery notes that carried the same initials in the margin, and she built a list of names that would get a talk when the team finished walking.

They crossed to an equipment alcove where a tie-down ring sat scuffed in a pattern that spoke of quick knots and faster exits. Dax measured the scuff length and looked up without drama. "Rig height matches a courier with a short reach," he noted. "Likely a woman or a young man, and the knot marks read like someone trained on the docks, not a book."

"Copy for profile," Halden confirmed. "I will pull past hires with dock time and a gap on last year's reviews."

A maintenance locker near the next junction held a cracked visor with solvent clouding at the edge and a strip of tape that bore a name half rubbed away. Hale peeled the tape off slow and slid it into a bag while Dax scraped a thin film from the visor with a clean blade. "Foam solvent is the same family we found in the gallery," he reported. "It eats cheap plastic and leaves this pattern when hands forget to wash before they touch gear."

Draeven looked at the visor, the scuffs, and the routes, and a framework started to settle in his mind with the kind of weight that helps rather than slows. "We have trails," he concluded. "They are old, and they brought us to places that once mattered. We need to stop following and start naming every place that can feed this network."

"Build the list," Halden urged, not to push but to catch the moment when the work turns from chasing to mapping.

They took a bench in a quiet corner and laid out the ship like a supply diagram rather than a home. Hale wrote headings with block letters and left space under each: inventory rooms with door logs, fabrication shops with bench time, receiving docks with vendor flow, laundry with cart patterns, waste transfer with lift schedules, and small clinics that order parts no one audits because they pay in favors instead of tickets. Dax added columns for solvents by type, adhesives by cure time, tape by stamp, and battery packs by scoring. Draeven drew a narrow tree for delivery routes with branches that pointed to places where carts could pause for one minute without a camera seeing the hands that stepped away.

"Manufacturing," Hale continued, tapping the word to fix it in her mind. "We have three machine shops with enough skill to cut collars and shims without tripping a metric. Shop A does big work and will be hard to hide in. Shop B does repair and turns bills fast, which gives cover. Shop C is small, quiet, and friendly with night shift."

"Delivery," Dax added. "Carts and hands. Coded lamps on long corridors. Two runners for cover stories. The waste lift on odd hours. The laundry carts when the dryer vents run hot and cameras fog."

"Inventory," Draeven completed. "Vendor names that show twice when the part count shows once. Serial corners missing. Notes in margins written by one wrist even when the name changes. We flag every pattern and ask questions without telling people what answer we want."

Halden listened to the list and built a query that pulled three months of door logs for those rooms, matched them to shift rosters, overlaid cart movement from low cameras, and flagged any person who touched more than one of those routes in a week. She pushed a first pass to their slates so they could see a day through the eyes of a clerk who moved too cleanly through tight spaces.

They went back to the walk. A bin behind a fabricator's bench held cut-off discs worn down to coins, and two of them carried a faint smear of adhesive that did not belong near a metal wheel. Hale bagged both and marked them for cure-time testing because cure time turns into a clock. A strip of floor near the rear door bore a stepped scratch that lined up with a cart that carried weight, turned short, and left with urgency. Dax measured the stride and traced the path to a side hatch where paint masked a repair, and he made a note to pull the panel for joint work and logged the tool needed so no one wasted a trip.

Draeven stopped at a patch of wall where scuff marks sat just at shoulder height, then he lifted his hand and pressed his palm where hands had rested before. People wait here when they need to pass a small thing without being seen, and the corridor angle kept faces hidden from the nearest camera. He logged the spot and drew a line to the nearest safe turn, then asked Halden to pull faces who paused here longer than a breath.

"Pulling now," Halden confirmed. "I also have vendor invoices that feed into Shop B with an extra half crate each run. The initials in the margins line up with a clerk whose hours drift wider than policy permits."

"Name," Draeven prompted.

"Linda Marris on paper and Linda Marris on a locker," Halden returned. "Two warnings last year for missing forms, and a clean line since then that reads like someone started watching their handwriting."

Hale marked the name without color or tone that could bias the next step. "We interview with a chair, water, and a recorder," she planned. "We do not corner her in a corridor. We give her a chance to understand that we are counting everything now."

Dax leaned on the bench and looked at the tools without touching them. "We also find every place a micro-coupler can hide," he proposed. "We check fans, vents, and hollow rails on hand trucks. We break down two carts from each deck and weigh each part against the catalog."

"Do it," Draeven agreed. "We will look slow, and we will work clean. We will miss less that way."

They moved again and found a small stash that had survived a quick sweep: two empty adhesive tubes with a stamp pattern they recognized, a roll of tape with a fresh edge, and a blade wrapped in cloth like a favor to the next hand. Hale photographed the scene before they touched anything, Dax lifted the items in order with gloved care, and Draeven logged the find with a location, a time, and a short note on the alley of routes that fed this room.

When they reached the lift to the upper decks, Halden pushed an overlay to their slates that turned the ship into a web of likely sources and routes, with thick lines for proof and thin lines for strong guesswork. "This is the starting net," she outlined. "We will fill it with names, rooms, vendor flows, and cart paths. We will also place our own beacons in the form of checks that show movement without forcing a chase."

Draeven studied the map and felt the shape of the next days settle into the kind of work that pays off in small, honest coins. "We have been late," he admitted, because the truth kept teams from lying to themselves. "We can get smarter than late if we treat the ship like a supply problem instead of a hunt."

Hale met his eyes and held them. "We will treat it like a supply problem then," she agreed. "We will find the sources, we will follow the routes, and we will make the next handoff too expensive to attempt."

Dax closed the kit and checked his count with a quiet click that marked the end of this pass. "Next stop is the laundry deck," he proposed. "We walk carts and vents, then we read the waste lift schedule against door logs."

"Go," Draeven directed, with a short nod that carried decision and trust. "We will keep the pace steady, and we will let the patterns do the talking."

They stepped into the lift with a plan that fit into pockets and minds, and the doors closed on a team that had chosen method over speed because method wins more often when people are hiding in plain sight. The lift hummed with a clean tone, the floor felt solid under boots built for long days, and the next level waited with the same calm light and the same promise that careful hands can turn scattered clues into a line you can walk without guesswork.
