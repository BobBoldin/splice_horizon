Chapter 44 --- Hands That Arrive On Time

The training hall lived behind two heavy doors and a simple sign that read "Range Three." Fluorescents gave an honest light without shimmer. The floor ran level across a grid of matte tiles that held traction under sweat and rubber. A rack along the wall carried practice batons, padded shields, and helmets with full face protection. Six compact training bots waited on charging cradles with their arms folded to their sides and their heads down like appliances that store well. Hale stood in the center with an empty belt, hair tied back, and a focus that sat low in her chest.

Rane walked the perimeter once and checked every target mount with her thumb. A technician rolled a cart to the control stand, keyed up the profile for "Reflex Suite Bench, Phase One," and looked to Hale. Elias observed from behind glass with a clipboard and a flat expression that kept the room steady. Two medics stood at a station with cuff, pulse oximeter, and cooldown kit laid out clean for quick hands.

Hale loosened her shoulders and wrists while she counted to thirty under her breath. The reflex suite sat in her joints now, quiet and present like a new tool that would do exactly what she asked at the speed she could earn. Her eyes had their own pace and her mind had its own habits. She understood that the body would fire faster than the picture, for a while, and that balance would come only when the picture taught the body what to expect. She respected that order. She preferred clean work to fireworks.

Rane stepped into her line of view. "We step by measures," she briefed, voice even. "Bot one on low speed. You stand square, receive the rhythm, and let your hands arrive without force. We build pace in layers. When the picture lands late, you hold position and teach it the beat. We do not chase speed. We earn it."

Hale met her eyes and gave one short nod. "Understood," she answered. The word came calm, without bravado.

The technician lifted a hand toward the glass. Elias returned a small nod. The first bot came alive with a soft motor tone and rolled off its cradle to the floor. A light on its head turned green. Its arm rose to guard height. It stepped forward, not a lunge, just a measured entry that asked a question about distance and timing. Hale settled her weight through the balls of her feet and brought her hands up with palms turned inward.

The bot threw a straight line to the shoulder. Hale's arm moved with perfect speed and met the strike on the forearm with a short turn that robbed the bot of leverage. Her new timing arrived before her eyes finished the picture. The block landed correct. The follow-up did not. Her other hand started a trap before her head committed to the angle, and she let it stop short rather than complete a grip that might slide into nonsense. The bot recovered and jabbed low. She read it late by one count and took the tap on the hip pad because grace under error builds trust faster than a frantic save.

"Good choice," Rane observed from the edge. "Build position. Do not chase the miss."

Hale centered again. The bot offered a left-right pair with a tight rhythm. Her hands met the first, then arrived early at the second. The second block struck air and made her balance tilt half a degree. She planted her feet, re-leveled her hips, and forced her eyes to track the shoulders instead of the gloves. The next exchange looked cleaner, with the picture and the hands closer to one beat.

They worked for five minutes on that slow cadence. Elias watched her pulse hold steady and her skin tone stay even. A single drop ran from the hairline and tracked along her temple. He wrote one line on his clipboard: "hands lead; eyes learning; posture disciplined."

"Phase two," Rane instructed. "Two-step entries. Moderate speed. Remember the floor."

Two bots rolled forward together and took angles that framed Hale at ten and two. Their motors hummed with a higher pitch that matched the new pace. Hale let her head turn early so her eyes owned both edges. A left bot flicked a high tap to test range. Her right hand snapped up and met it. The right bot slid low toward the knee. Her left leg shifted to shorten the target and her left hand dropped for a seal, yet her grip still outran the picture by a breath. The bot's glove touched the pad above her knee.

The tap stung. Pride lifted its head. She pressed it back down with a long breath through her nose and returned to square.

Rane lifted a palm. "Let the picture lead this time," she coached. "Count a half beat before you fire. Your suite will still arrive first."

Hale fixed her eyes on the triangle formed by both bots' shoulders. She counted a clean "one" inside her chest before she answered the next test. The pause felt like an invitation to get hit. Instead, it gave her body the right lane. The next four taps met her forearms and palms clean. The suite brought speed. The count brought control. She could feel the two learning each other without strain.

The technician raised the speed one more notch. The bots spun into a short flurry: high-low, low-high, then a wrap that probed for a grab. Hale took one on the forearm and one on the ribs, then found the wrap and cut it with a wrist roll that her hands had known for years. The new timing finished the roll before the bot completed its circle. The trap fell into place. She let it go rather than throw, because she would conserve throws until balance ran perfect.

Elias leaned toward the mic. "Hydrate," he suggested. "Then we add pressure."

Hale stepped back, took two long swallows from her bottle, and set it on the floor by the wall. The technician fetched a face shield and handed it to her. She clipped it on and tested the seal with two fingers against the chin band. Bean-bag cannons rose from four corners of the room, low and high, set to a speed that bruises but does not break. The bots powered down and rolled back. Rane signaled a new sequence.

"Eyes only," she called. "Ten bags in thirty seconds. You track flight and lean away by inches. No blocks yet. Teach your head the line."

The first bag shot from the far left. Hale felt the reflex suite load her calves and hips on a hair trigger. She denied the urge to swat and let her weight shift just enough to clear the path. The bag passed a hand's breadth from her cheek. The next arrived from the high right. She dipped her head rather than drop her posture. The bag shaved the edge of her shield and smacked the pad behind her with a flat thump. The next three arrived in a tight rhythm. She let them pass near while her body recorded speed, angle, and spin. Her lungs worked smooth. Her feet never crossed.

"Hands now," Rane called. "Small parries only. Think economy."

Bags began to fly from four corners without pattern. Hale lifted her left hand two inches to turn one aside with the heel of her palm, then swiveled her right wrist to redirect another past her ear. The reflex suite kept speed ready at her joints. Her eyes fed it cleaner now because the simple drill had set lanes in her head. She adjusted parry angles by degrees and felt strain drop. Her shield picked up two glancing hits, which registered as data rather than failure.

The room paused. Rane conferred with Elias through the glass with a tilt of her chin. Elias raised two fingers for "add" and the technician nodded.

"Back to bots," Rane instructed. "Two at once for real engagement. Bags remain live at low rate. Finish each touch with a position that gives you the next answer."

Two bots rolled in from left and right. A bag launched from the rear as they moved. Hale tracked the bag first with a small head turn and let it fly past her shoulder. The left bot threw a straight line. Her right hand met it clean while her left tucked to avoid opening her ribs. The right bot snapped low. Her left forearm slid down for a seal, and she let her hip draw back in the same beat to keep distance. The reflex suite filled in the speed. Her eyes kept playback sharp enough to mean something.

The bot at her left offered a false high and shot a hook. She met the arm with a hard parry and turned the bot's shoulder just enough to break its base. She could have thrown there. She chose a redirect instead, trusting the drill to reward control over drama. The bag from the rear arrived as she reset. She tilted her head and let it glance off the shield rather than risk a hand out of lane.

They worked the two-bot drill for ten minutes. Her body learned to collect the new pace without bending the old rules. She stopped reaching. She stopped over-correcting. Hands landed in the right place and then left early for the next beat. The suite made each arrival on time. The eyes drew each map before the hands crossed the street.

Over the next weeks Hale made rapid improvements. It was less thinking about what action to take and more just letting her body take that action.

In todays session, Rane stepped forward and lifted a hand. The bots rolled back. "We add more," she briefed. "Six bots at standard speed. Cannons remain live at a count that keeps you honest. The goal reads clean: control the room without stepping into a throw until you own every line. When you own them, you throw once and you finish the set. We aim for three sets. We accept one today if fatigue writes limits."

Hale rolled her shoulders again and set her feet on the center cross. She checked the seal on her shield, lifted her hands, and let her breath fall into a pattern she trusted on long days. Elias wrote "phase three" on his sheet and printed a small box beside it for a simple check mark. The medics reset their timers and watched her color.

Six bots rolled free of their cradles, spread into a half circle, and closed until each held a lane that reached her without tripping on a neighbor. The cannons loaded with twelve bags and set their randomizer to a spread that challenges without turning people into targets. The room waited for a count from Rane. Hale found her balance and eased into a stance that wasted nothing.

"Begin," Rane called.

The first bot stepped in with a quick jab to test distance. Hale touched it away with two knuckles and stole a half step to deaden the lane. A bag cut past her right ear. She let it pass and kept her shoulder soft. The second bot dove low with a grab. Her left hand found the forearm and her right hand found the head. She turned both together in a small circle and set the bot down without drama. The third bot filled the gap at her left with a high line. She met it and guided it past while her left foot skated a short inch to keep her hips square.

A bag from the rear arrived at crown height. She dropped her chin and felt the wind of it through the shield vent. The fourth bot tried to wrap. Her left elbow found the hinge in its movement and wrote a quiet "no" that sent its arms wide again. The fifth bot popped from her right with three quick taps. She met the first, cut the second, and ignored the third because the angle made it die before it mattered. The sixth bot waited for a clean lane like a patient worker.

Hale felt the tempo take her body and return it, smooth now. The suite gave her hands the same energy she once begged from stimulus. Her eyes placed each piece in a mental grid that matched the floor. When a bag flew, the grid absorbed it. When a bot threw, the grid labeled it and then erased it after the touch. She kept her breath steady and her chin level.

The room raised speed by one notch. The bots gained a step. The cannons packed less time between throws. Hale compressed her parries by two inches and brought her elbows closer to home. The picture stayed legible because she kept it simple. The fifth bot tried for a knee. She shortened the target and gave it a soft forearm that turned the idea into wasted motion. The second bot returned with a grab. She let the grab land on leather rather than skin, then spun the bot's hands aside and set it off balance. The sixth bot finally entered with intent, which let her throw one clean circle.

She took the throw. Hands wrapped, hips turned, feet walked the small path, and the bot met the floor center with a padded thud. She released early and reset her stance because the room still held five other machines and a dozen bags.

Rane's voice carried across the floor. "Own it," she called, measured and calm. "Keep the math."

Hale owned it. She stayed inside small motions and honest lines. When the third bot pressed high, she pressed higher and stole its balance. When the first bot tried to run the same test three times, she punished the third with a wrist bite that the algorithm would learn from. When a bag looked rich for a catch, she let it fly and saved her hands for work that mattered. She worked through the first set without a throw beside that one circle and brought every bot to a stall with angle and touch.

"Set one," Rane confirmed. "Two to go."

Elias watched her color lift a shade and then steady. He wrote "fatigue even" and drew a check. The medics traded a look and loosened their posture by a hair.

Hale lifted her hands again and rolled her neck once to keep the nerves calm under the skin. The bots reset and came on with new recipes. The cannons sent three in a row toward her left eye level. She deflected one and let two pass within a finger's width because the safest parry in life sometimes looks like confidence rather than contact. The second set felt easier in the bones and harder in the lungs, which told her the training worked.

She finished the second set with a clean bind-release on the fourth bot and a body turn that split two lines at once. The room paused for water. Rane handed her the bottle. Hale drank without gulping and gave it back without shaking. Her eyes stayed dark and focused. She preferred this to any battle story. Training wrote the stories that kept people standing.

"Final set," Rane briefed. "Cannons full count. Bots run standard aggression. You finish with a floor if the room grants it. No fatigue throws. Only clean math."

Hale lifted her hands and let twenty years of drills line up inside her chest. The bots formed and pressed. The cannons threw with a rhythm that wanted to trick eyes and hands. She worked inside the rhythm without giving it her throat. A bag passed close enough for her to feel its seam, and she leaned just a hair to let it pass. A bot presented both hands for a classic wrap. She answered with a spine line and a hand trap that neutralized the idea without risk.

Then the room offered her the picture she had waited for: two bots crowded a lane without reading each other, and a third drifted behind them out of sync. The cannons paused for a breath after a heavy volley. Her eyes marked the triangle. Her hands filled the first two spots. Her hips turned for the third. The suite delivered timing that merged with judgment. She threw a tight figure-four, rode the body down into the mat, and released as the other two cleared her shoulders. The throw landed with a single hard sound that told everyone the math had been right.

"Set three," Rane called, satisfaction warm in the word.

The cannons fired the last four bags in a fast cross. Hale parried one, slipped one, let one glance the shield, and caught the final bag with a short, sharp clap that impressed no one and pleased her in a small private way. She tossed the bag to the floor and reset her stance because she preferred endings that look like beginnings.

Silence followed, the good kind that comes after honest work. The bots rolled back to their cradles and slotted in with a tone that held no triumph. The cannons lowered. The technician shut the board down with practiced keystrokes. The medics stepped forward and checked her pulse and the color under her nails. Elias left the glass and entered the room with his clipboard under his arm.

Rane met Hale at center and placed a hand on her shoulder. "You earned the suite today," she told her. "You did not let the speed drag you. You brought it into line."

Hale unclipped the face shield and drew a slow breath. "The first minute felt like my hands tried to live ahead of my eyes," she admitted, tone level. "Then the picture learned the beat. The bags taught me patience. The bots taught me where to spend."

Elias looked from Hale to the board and then to his sheet. "Numbers look clean," he reported. "Inner-ear drift reads flat. Joint heat lands inside comfort. You earned food, salt, and six hours of calm."

Rane glanced to the technician. "Run the tally," she requested.

"Six bots for three sets," the technician recited. "Twelve bag impacts total across all angles. Three contacts on the shield. Zero contacts on bare skin. One clean throw by design, two stalls by angle control. Session length: thirty-two minutes of active pressure."

Hale rotated her wrists and felt no grit in the motion. "I will stretch before food," she noted. "Then I will sleep the way the panel likes."

Rane stepped to Elias. "We set her next session?" she asked.

"Two days," Elias replied. "We keep the load heavy and the pace honest."

Rane nodded and turned back to Hale. "You will brief Dax and Joren on what felt true," she invited. "Teach them from the inside."

"I will," Hale answered. "Dax will enjoy the math. Joren will enjoy the corridor when his turn arrives."

Rane's eyes softened. "He will walk it," she agreed. "You will count the marks."

Hale wiped sweat from her temple with the back of her wrist, gathered her shield and bottle, and walked to the rack to hang the gear. Her hands moved without flourish. She felt tired in the good way that a shift on the line gives. The reflex suite no longer felt like a thin whisper under her skin. It felt like a steady partner that waited for clear orders and delivered without complaint.

As she left Range Three, the corridor light eased to the softer tone that signals late afternoon. Voices drifted in from another hall where a small class worked through a basic drill with foam batons and heavy laughter. She checked her watch, calculated a meal that would meet the numbers, and pictured Joren on the bars with Kaela counting under her breath. The image brought a heat to her chest she did not need to hide. She planned to bring him a simple story about how speed respects discipline and how a patient eye writes better music than a fast hand.

In the mess, Dax lifted two fingers from his tray when she entered. He clocked her posture first, then her color, then the small line at her hairline where the shield had pressed. "How did it treat you," he asked, voice clean of challenge.

"It paid what I put into it," Hale returned, sitting across from him. "The first minute taught me humility. The last ten taught me joy. The bags wrote the map. The bots respected the map."

Dax's mouth curled. "Good work," he offered. "I will draw the anchors through the cone tomorrow. Bring your eye and your patience."

"They will travel with me," she promised.

Rane passed the table with a tray and a nod, then moved on to brief Colvern. Elias stepped into the doorway, glanced at Hale, and allowed his face to ease by a small degree that counted as pride in his language. He walked on with his clipboard under his arm because that tool belonged in his hand the way the Longcoil belonged in Dax's and the throw belonged in Hale's hips.

Hale ate without rushing and listened to the room. The ship carried the steady sound of men and women who worked, rested, and prepared to work again. She felt the reflex suite settle deeper into her joints like a promise kept. She carried that promise out of the mess and down the corridor toward sleep, with the simple intention of waking ready to teach her hands and eyes one more beat. The day had delivered. The next would, too, because the work ran clean and the people honored it.
