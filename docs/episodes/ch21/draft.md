Chapter 21 - Helmets and Hands

The corridor outside Armory Two held the quiet you get before first movement: boots on rubber, canvas sliding over metal, a few clipped words that stayed close to the speaker. Lockers opened and closed in order as people finished their checks. No one needed a speech, and no one tried to be funny. The work ahead was enough to fill the room.

Hale set her carbine on the bench and ran the sighting sequence again, not because she doubted it but because repetition is what keeps a hand honest when the air tightens. She tugged the holster, tested the chest rig pull, then seated a fresh magazine and confirmed the amber safety band. The motion settled her pulse the way a good stretch settles a tight back. She glanced to her left. Joren stood at his station with his checklist held at an angle, reading each line under his breath so his hands would track his mouth. He looked young, and he knew it, but he had the sense to slow himself down.

"Helmets," Draeven said, even tone. "Then hands."

Helmets clicked into place along the line. Hands went up, palms open, fingers spread, the simple show that there was nothing hidden and everything ready. Halden walked the row and checked seals, bands, spare magazines, and the door pouches where the stunners sat in pairs. She tightened a loose cap on a dot sight and tapped Dax's case. He lifted the lid just enough to show the Longcoil tag, the Breach-six tube, the net canister, and the foam rig with its safety flagged. She dropped the lid and met his eyes.

"On call only," she said.

"On call," he answered.

Rane stepped in with a folded map and a clipped marker. Her mouth was set the way it gets when she does not plan to repeat herself. She set the map on the wall board, drew a clean circle around the derelict mining encampment, and looked at the squad.

"Intel is thin," she said. "Renegades with visible splice alteration have co-opted the galleries and the lower tunnels. Expect narrow lanes, poor sight lines, and jury-rigged surprises. We go in tight. Confined spaces mean no hero moves and no blind sprints. Capture alive where possible. Otherwise, neutralize the threat and extract all personnel safely."

She let that hang for a moment, then pointed with the marker. "Hale on point. Dax carries the specials on my call. Halden runs checks and rear coordination. Joren, you are rear security and nav. If you are not sure about a turn, ask. If you cannot see a lane, say so. Speed is not useful if it breaks the line."

Joren swallowed, then nodded. "Yes, ma'am."

He felt the heat of his own breath inside the helmet and the faint itch where the strap met his jaw. The checklist had steadied him, but the word "tunnel" sat heavy in his chest. He did not want to be the one who moved too fast and made other people pay for it. He pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth and waited for the next instruction.

"Load and safe," Draeven said.

Magazines locked in with quiet, precise sounds. Hale rolled her shoulders, felt the harness settle where it should, and took the first clean breath she had had all morning. The armory smelled like gun oil, dry cloth, and the cold edge of recycled air. Beyond the door, the ship carried the faint vibration that meant power was where it needed to be. None of it tried to be dramatic. It was simply there to be used.

Halden stepped in front of Joren and checked his rear strap, then clipped a chemical light low and pressed the tape flat with the back of her knuckles. "I want to see you even when you turn your head," she said. "Call the corners. Keep your pace one count under what your fear is pushing for."

He let out a small breath he had been holding. "Understood."

Rane capped the marker and put it in her pocket. "We are not out there to teach anyone a lesson about pride," she said. "We are out there to bring people home and to shut down a problem that will grow if we ignore it. Remember the order of work: identify, control, detain, and report. If you have to shoot, you shoot to stop, not to kill."

Dax closed his case and clipped it. "Copy."

Hale looked down the line. The squad looked back with the calm of people who had moved together enough times to trust the shape of the unit more than the noise in their own heads. She felt the familiar rise of focus that replaced the chatter of stray thought. It was not comfort exactly, but it was a firm place to stand.

"Stack," Draeven said.

They formed at the inner hatch with hands where they belonged and eyes where they needed to be. Halden gave the nod. The hatch slid open on a draft that smelled like dust and cold metal from the service side. The air had that old station flavor that sticks to a tongue and tells you nothing has lived here in a long time without help.

"Go," Rane said.

Hale took the first step into the service corridor with her muzzle low and her sight ready to rise. The sound of their passage was controlled and small: rubber soles, muted clicks, one quiet word when a corner came. Joren took the rear and marked each feature as he went: a numbered panel with a missing screw, a faded stripe, a ladder oval that would take two at a time. His ribs felt tight for three breaths, then he found the rhythm of the pace and matched it, a half count behind on purpose.

They cleared the first junction by the book: slice, check, cover, move. Dax watched the high pipe rack and the dark lip where a cable tray turned into shadow. Halden called a short halt at a set of wire loops that could have been nothing or could have been a poor man's alarm. She pointed with two fingers. Hale set a mirror, looked, and shook her head. Not a trap, just a tie-off. They moved.

Rane spoke once more on the net, her voice steady without strain. "This is a capture mission with a safety margin," she said. "Keep your heads. Keep your hands clean. We do not write history today. We do our jobs and we come back."

They reached the last bulkhead before the galleries. Hale held up two fingers and then one. The door seals looked tired, and the sight window was grimed enough to force them to trust the fiber cam. Joren passed it forward without being asked. Hale fed the cable under the lip, watched the small screen, and drew the camera back.

"Two bodies," she said. "One seated, one on a knee. Both armed. Sight lines are poor. We go left-right, low first."

Draeven's reply came without heat. "Set it and take it."

Hale looked once at Joren. "Rear holds until called," she said. "If a runner comes past, step to the wall and make your body wide. Let us do the hitting."

"I will hold," he said.

They set for the breach. The last seconds stretched the way they always do when noise is about to replace quiet. It did not feel like a movie. It felt like work they had trained to do, and there was room inside that to be afraid and still act. Hale counted them down and opened the door. The first room arrived all at once. The squad moved the way they had practiced. And then they were inside the problem they had come to solve.

Hale cleared left. The first target rose from a crouch with a smooth coil and then blurred, a thin man in stained work canvas whose joints seemed to carry springs that did not belong in a human body. He covered half the room before Hale finished the second angle of her slice. The air in front of him shimmered with heat from his skin, not steam but a dry radiance like he ran hot at idle.

"Fast," Hale called, already shifting. "Joren, rear stays off the lane."

Dax took right. His target was thick through the chest and neck, shoulders rolled forward like a lifter's, veins ridged under a gray film that looked like plates had grown where soft skin should be. His forearms were braided hard, the hands swollen and square. When he stood, the crate he had been sitting on creaked and stayed down a thumb's width from where it had started. He did not roar. He just set his feet.

"Strong," Dax said, calm, like he was labeling a specimen. "On me."

The fast one went first, because that is what fast people do. He tested space with a feint toward Hale, then walked the wall in a short burst and tried to come off the angle behind her muzzle. Hale had seen it before in training halls and once on a bad night in a cargo bay. She pivoted on her left foot, dropped her center, and used all that talk she once called "physics" without smiling: hands to forearm, forearm to shoulder, shoulder to hips. The fast man's ankles were still chasing his plan when she took his balance from him. He went from vertical to horizontal in the span it takes to exhale, and he met the floor with his whole back at once. The sound was the simple, flat slap of mass returning to where mass lives. For half a second his eyes lost their aim.

"Stun ready," Halden said, already moving, but Hale held up a hand to check the throw. "Not yet."

Across the room, the strong one stepped into Dax's space with a steady patience that belonged in a gym, not a fight. Dax fired a controlled pair into the man's chest with frangible loads, the kind that should break and dump energy without punching through. The rounds hit and powdered; the big man rocked, then set again like someone had asked him to take a light push. Dax switched targets and put one into the thigh to test joint response. The leg bent, and for a moment the knee thought about giving. The man's skin flushed a dark, mottled red around the impact, and then the color cleared.

"Plating," Dax said. "Diffuse. Not full."

Rane's voice stayed even on the net. "Less lethal first. Net if you get the window."

The fast man rolled on one shoulder, came up on a knee, and was moving again before a normal person would have found their hands. He kept his chin tucked and his eyes low, which made him harder to read. Hale did not chase speed with speed. She cut angles and fed him into corners he did not want. He slipped past her muzzle once and brushed the outside of her wrist with a strike that would have taken a gun from most people. Hale's grip tightened because she trains that grip until her forearm shakes. He bought himself two steps and no more.

"Joren, mark door two," Halden said. "If he runs, that is his line."

"Marked," Joren said. He kept his back to the wall and his eyes honest. The room smelled like metal shavings and cold oil. Sweat ran into the curve of his collar. He did not like how light his legs felt.

Dax changed approach. He holstered, slid the Breach-six off the clip, and thumbed disc slugs into the tube. The strong man tracked him and did not blink. He stepped forward, lifted both hands like he planned to grab the barrel and simply bend it. Dax fired the first disc at center mass from ten paces. The slug hit like a small shield thrown by a bitter friend. It spread, stuck, and pushed. The man took a full step back, then another, and then he tore the disc free with both hands and threw it behind him. The skin under the adhesive looked raw but unbroken. His eyes watered in a way that spoke to nerves being cheated and not liking it.

"Second disc with left bias," Dax said to no one in particular. He did not change his tone. The second shot came in just off the first and pinned the right shoulder long enough for Halden to close. She snapped a cuff on that wrist with a clean turn and immediately stepped out because the man's left hand came up hard and high in a hook that would have taken her jaw. It clipped her helmet instead and set a spark at the edge of her vision. She kept her feet because she trains to keep them.

"Fine," she said, like she was swatting away a bug that had earned the hit. "He is not considerate."

Hale timed the fast man's next rush. He cut toward Joren's mark, saw the chemlight, and corrected to the blind side. Hale gave him what looked like a lane and then took it away at the last inch. Her knee checked his thigh, her left hand found the back of his elbow, and her right hand pressed down on the crown of his head. The move felt like guiding a heavy lid down onto a pot. He went horizontal for the second time in one minute, face toward the floor. She did not slam him. She set him down with enough authority to tell his nervous system the choice was poor.

"Now," she said.

Halden's S-Pulse came low and slightly behind the left shoulder. The flash and pressure hit the fast man's rib cage and stole his rhythm without stealing his breath. He did not go limp. He stuttered, reached for the wrong direction, and then tried to stand on knees that wanted to be ankles.

"Hold," Rane said. "Do not crowd him. Let it work."

On Dax's side, the strong man refused to be a simple problem. He stepped into the push of the second disc, leaned his weight forward like a dock worker, and used the mass of his chest as a tool. Dax took one step back to keep space and fired a third disc at the left hip. It took, and now the big man carried two anchors and a bad knee. He tried to bull forward anyway because some bodies know only one story and they tell it until the end.

"Foam ready," Dax said.

"Use it," Rane answered.

Dax snapped the Nimbus nozzle up and hosed a short line across the man's shins and the floor in front of him. The foam bloomed into a low wall, tacky and strong. The big man's next step buried his boots to the ankle. He pulled once and gained a hand's breadth. He pulled again and lost it. Halden circled right and found the clean angle for the second cuff, but she did not commit yet. She waited for the breath to leave him in a long exhale. When it came, she set the cuff and rolled out.

"Cuffs on," she called. "Do not test him until solvent."

"Timer," Dax said, glancing at his wrist. "Ten to set, thirty to clear."

The fast man did not like being handled. He was on his knees again, eyes clear and too bright. He rocked back, launched, and got a hand on Hale's rig. She felt the pull and let the waist strap take it while her hips turned. The old training rose: change vectors, shorten levers, make the ground help you. She redirected him a third time, this one harder, and his chin found the floor with a short, ugly click that pulled a sound out of Joren's throat before he could stop it.

"Stunner again," Hale said, breath steady.

Halden placed it closer to the shoulder this time and at an angle that favored muscle over bone. The man's limbs shook in a small, high-speed tremor. He tried to stand and got halfway. He tried to punch and hit nothing. He tried to speak and found only a hiss. He folded to his side, still fighting, but each attempt was smaller than the last.

"Bind him," Rane said.

Hale took a knee by his hip, watched his hands, and waited one more breath to be sure. Then the zip cuffs went on, wrists first, ankles second, hands to belt with a short tether to prevent rolling. She checked finger color and capillary response because capture means care. "Circulation is good," she said. "He will bruise and he earned it."

On the other side, the foam set. Dax pointed the solvent and counted down. The foam slumped and slid. The big man drew both feet free with a grunt that belonged on a lifting platform. He tried to surge, and three things happened at once: the discs dragged him off balance, Halden redirected his wrist with a simple turn that put his palm toward the ceiling, and Dax stepped behind the knee and let gravity finish the argument. The man went down in a controlled fall and kissed the floor with his shoulder and chest because that is what happens when the ground wins. He tried to rise, and two pairs of hands made that a plan for later.

"Bind and sedate," Rane said. "Standard dose."

Hale drew the sed kit and held for Halden's check. "No known allergies," Halden said. "Weight by tape. Go."

The fast man thrashed once at the prick of the needle and then eased over the course of a long count. The big man took his dose and glared through it with eyes that did not understand why a room had rules.

"Vitals stable," Halden said after a quick read. "Both transportable."

Joren finally let his shoulders drop. He did not like that his hands shook, so he closed each into a fist and opened them again until they steadied. He looked at Hale without trying to hide it. "You made that look simple."

"It was not," Hale said. "It was physics and practice. You will get both."

Rane scanned the room. Two weapons on the floor, one crude splice kit in a box that had once held drill heads, a line on the wall where someone had done pull-ups until the paint failed. She logged it all in her head and then out loud for the record.

"Tag the kit. Bag the weapons. Photo the bindings. Move them to Holding One. We are not here to break bones for pride. We are here to stop a spread and bring answers back to the medical bay."

She looked at Joren last. "Rear security stays in the lane. Call corners. Keep your pace one count under what your fear is pushing for."

"Yes, ma'am," he said, and it felt better in his mouth this time.

They lifted the two prisoners in practiced ways that keep joints safe and tempers down, then formed up for the next door. The noise in the room settled to measured breathing and the soft work sounds of bags, straps, and tags being set. The fight had been real and close. It had also been controlled. That difference is why people walk back out.
