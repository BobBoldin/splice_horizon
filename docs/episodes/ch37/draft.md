Chapter 37 --- Second Wind

The debris field settled into a rough quiet that carried the scrape of grit across plates and the long tone of a line under steady load. Aria held position against the spar and watched the numbers climb back into a healthy band, then she drew one slow breath and let her voice carry a calm that fit the room. "Status by name, then we reset the plan and finish the job."

"Keon, here and upright," Keon answered with a dry humor that eased the knot behind everyone's ribs. "Grip steady, hips fine after the brace, and a strong preference for lines that stay attached."

"Tomas, here with one patch and a wrist that listens," Tomas followed, flexing his fingers once so the message traveled to Lysa without a speech. "Readings stable, scanner clean, and logs complete on the override."

"Elian, here with a collar that likes our choices," Elian put in, voice rough from the strain yet steady in its purpose. "Plate sits flush and wants the next rise when we choose it."

"Lysa, present," she concluded, eyes on every face before they shifted to the board. "Windows closed, curves smooth, and a cooldown kit ready for any aftershock."

Aria let the count rest in the channel for a beat. The anchor held true, the beacon at position one broadcast a clean pulse, and the work in front of them still asked for hands and judgment rather than drama. She felt the ache along her thigh where a shard had grazed the outer plate and filed it under later, then let a sliver of humor through because teams breathe better when a leader gives them room for it.

"Keon, your rescue line landed like it came off a practice reel," she offered, voice warm. "Your hand finds good catches."

"It learns from careful teachers," he returned, glancing over with a smile that lived behind the visor. "Soft release, firm hold, and a promise to check knots twice."

"Save the workshop for after the pull," Lysa interjected with a friendly edge, though her eyes lingered on Keon's shoulders long enough to read fresh tremor and discard it. "We still owe the field two beacons and a clean handoff."

"Point taken," Keon replied, humor banked and ready for later. "I will keep the rope talk where it helps."

Aria rolled her shoulders once and brought the slate into view. "Plan holds with one change," she briefed. "We keep the anchor at twenty while we throw beacon two from the safe line that skirts the new scatter. After placement, we lift to thirty under Elian's eye, then we meet the tow for proof. Windows stay short, and timing rides the board, not the ego."

"Copy across the board," Tomas affirmed, tone even as his hands checked the patch edge with careful pressure. "Triplex stays green under this plan, and dosage profiles remain staged rather than stacked."

They moved as a unit through a short translation, tethers arranged with an economy that came from training and a shared wish to finish right the first time. The second beacon site lived behind a curtain of slow debris that caught light like dust in morning air, so Aria took the long curve and used her lamp to draw a steady horizon for Keon while Lysa tracked small shards the way a shepherd tracks a restless flank. Elian stayed with the anchor and watched the torque marks through the corner of his eye, patient as granite when patience builds safety. Tomas tracked electromagnetic noise and watched for the hiccup that steals seconds, and he shaped his breath so the scanner hand stayed true.

At the mark, Aria clipped high and set her stance. "Beacon two throws from this face," she outlined, checking the plate and the mount points, then bringing the unit into her hands with the same respect she gave a live tool. "Tomas, pre-fire now. Lysa, clock on my lift. Keon, set my cone and keep a clean wake."

"Pre-fire clean," Tomas reported after a steady sweep. "No amber, profiles staged, and range within spec for a first-pass lock."

"Timer running," Lysa confirmed, thumb quick on the slate, eyes already on Aria's wrists for that telltale twitch that wants help before the mouth asks.

Keon eased an arm out and sealed the little eddies that steal accuracy, then brought the coil near her hip so the stow would take one movement and nothing more. Aria breathed into the count that kept hands honest, then lifted, extended, and let the beacon ride a smooth line to the plate. The click traveled through her bones like a door closing well, and the indicator stepped through its brief dance toward steady green.

"Beacon two lives and speaks," Tomas announced with a tight smile. "Signal clean across the corridor, and the repeater likes the angle."

Aria logged the placement with a quick photo and a mark, then turned back to the anchor where Elian waited with the stillness that follows focused work. "We bring the anchor to thirty on your call," she directed. "Read the face while Brant feathers the drum."

"I like the metal for this rise," Elian replied. "Left side shows the faintest bias, which clears with a half-degree correction during tension."

"Tow Skiff Grey ready for a smooth lift to thirty," Brant confirmed over the line, voice calm and present. "Feather stands ready when you count it."

"We count it," Lysa cued, keeping the room on one heartbeat. "Three, two, one."

Load grew with a steady grace, the strap stretched and settled, and the mark on the collar crept into alignment as Elian called for that small left move and Aria answered with a touch that lived in the shoulders rather than the hands. Keon watched the recoil cone and prepped a snubber across his thigh without fanfare, the little length of line lying flat and eager for honest work. Thirty landed and held, and the anchor face read true enough to make a careful man smile.

Aria felt the room ease a fraction and let the levity return for one safe breath. "You park that snubber like a man who stores rope in nightstands," she teased, giving the memory of the Greenlight a quick flash in her tone.

"Always within reach," Keon replied, laughter warm in his chest. "A knot that behaves and a headboard that forgives count as good design."

"Design goes into the log as a training note," Lysa cut in, humor alive even as her hands checked pack fittings. "We publish only the safe portions."

"Shipboard best practices," Tomas added, grateful for a laugh that cleared the taste of patch gel from his mouth. "Soft release, shared consent, and manufacturer-approved hardware."

Elian's chuckle rode the channel like a small boat on steady water. "This anchor approves of your priorities," he offered. "We keep it courteous at forty as well."

"Forty after a check," Aria chose, bringing them back to the line that keeps teams alive. "We confirm injuries for medical bay, inspect every tether and strap, and sweep the field for fresh scatter. Then we finish this pull and hand Brant a corridor he can brag about during dinner."

The inspection took shape with muscle memory and respect for timing boundaries. Lysa lifted Keon's visor enough to see the skin at his temples and count the tiny pulses that telegraph deeper strain; she found a clean rhythm and logged it. Tomas flexed his forearm and read the patch under light, then toggled a gentle taper on his oxygen profile so the curve would land without a lurch. Aria pressed a knuckle along her thigh panel where the shard had grazed; the plate had held and the padding had spread the force, which meant a bruise and a reminder rather than a problem. Elian checked fasteners with a finger and then a wrench at two points, and each mark aligned the way good work always rewards patience.

"Counts read green," Lysa concluded, tone firm and calm. "Profiles closed, gear intact, and bodies ready for the next rise."

"Tow Skiff Grey holds tension at thirty and waits for your mark," Brant reported. "Drum stands smooth and eager."

"Bring it to forty in a slow breath," Aria directed. "Elian, eyes on the plate. Keon, cone stays clean. Tomas, watch the scatter and the repeater. Lysa, keep our rhythm."

They listened through the lift and heard the line deepen, felt the collar settle that last hair into place, and watched the face align like a proof that finally chose to balance. The corridor between beacons brightened on the slate with a clean run of green, and the pull began to feel less like a rescue and more like the kind of work people brag about in quiet voices while cleaning tools.

Aria held the view and let the moment fix in memory: one team, marked and bruised, still aligned to the job they took at the start of the hour. "We finish the handoff and walk home in one piece," she told them, voice steady and full. "Greenlight owes us a table and a reason to forget the taste of metal."

"Make it a booth with a back," Keon replied, the smile audible. "Knotwork for demonstration purposes only."

"Training materials travel in closed bags," Lysa countered, relief easing her shoulders. "We keep the headboard lecture for consenting audiences."

"Anchor confirms forty and invites the proof," Elian reported, back to the music of the work. "This face holds like it means to live here."

"Tow Skiff Grey ready for proof pull on your count," Brant returned, already feathering the start with a craftsman's pride.

Aria looked once more across her team and found what she needed in each face: resolve in Keon's eyes, precision in Tomas's focus, care in Lysa's posture, and endurance written into Elian's jaw. The field still held teeth, yet the job carried the room. She lifted her lamp so every visor caught the same bright cue, then gave the word that turns a hard hour into a finished one.

"Proof on three: steady, clean, and ours."
