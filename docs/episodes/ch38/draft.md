Chapter 38 - The Next Step

The medical bay kept its morning rhythm: steady light, clean floors, and a row of parallel bars that turned effort into inches. Joren stood between the rails with a brace on his lower back, hands chalked to cut slip, and a therapist at his left shoulder who counted through each lift and set. The bruise along his ribs had faded to a dull map, and the world between head and feet felt heavier than memory, yet he owned more balance today than yesterday.

"Weight through your heels first," the therapist coached, calm and clear. "Knees soft, shoulders square, and eyes on the point ahead of you."

Joren fixed on a screw head in the far wall and brought one foot forward until the sole kissed the mat. The brace held him honest. The bars felt cool under his palms. His breath climbed the first step with him and settled once the floor accepted his weight. A faint shimmer ran through the muscles along his spine, then quieted as the count reached four.

He pictured an engagement ring during the second step. The image arrived like a tool placed on a bench: simple, sturdy, and ready for work. He had sketched five versions on scrap slates during bed rest, each with a different way to catch light without fussy edges. One used steel from a retired fastener. One used copper wire from a cut coil. The favorite used a small piece of Beacon housing he had pulled from a bin the week before the galleries mission. He would shape it round, set a thin groove along the edge, and leave the face plain so her hand would tell the story.

"Good," the therapist praised, watching the knees. "Two more like that, then a pause."

He set the third step and let the math of movement fill his head. Foot. Heel. Toes. Weight. Breath. The pain did not bark now; it lived as a pressure along a line he could understand. His hands felt strong yet honest about limits. He wanted this work to teach him patience because patience would carry him farther than a burst of pride.

Kaela's reflection arrived in the window beyond the bars before he heard her shoes. She wore a navy top and the lab badge clipped straight, hair pulled clean off her face, and a look that carried warmth without crowding. She waited for the therapist's nod, then took the chair near the foot of the mat and placed a bottle of water on the rail where his right hand would find it.

\"You picked the quiet hour I see,\" she greeted, warm and steady. \"I brought the good water and a hand when you ask for it.\"

His chest lifted for reasons that did not come from effort. "Perfect timing," he replied, keeping his eyes on the screw head because that target kept the next step true. "Two more and then a break."

He set the fourth step and felt the old confidence advance a fraction, like a tide you can measure if you keep patience with the markers. The therapist checked the brace, lifted a thumb, and eased back a half pace to let him own the lane. Joren counted the breath out through his nose and rested his weight evenly before he spoke again.

He kept the ring picture to himself and let it warm the hard parts, then he chose words that fit the hour. "I keep planning what\'s next in my head," he ventured, breath steadying. "I want those plans to stand on their own feet."

Kaela moved closer with her hands on the top rail, careful to leave his balance clear. "We will walk into that future step by step," she replied, eyes steady. "Your legs first, then whatever promise you choose to carry."

He liked that order. He liked the way her mouth softened on the word plan and the way her eyes watched his center of gravity as if watching that line counted as care. He set the fifth step and let his heel find the mat. The brace supported without arguing. His palms grew damp; chalk did its job. He held the posture for a full count and then rested with knees easy.

He pictured the ask again and laid it out in a sequence he could trust. Steel ring finished and tucked in a pocket. A hallway she loves with quiet air and honest light. A clean shirt. A steady hand. He wanted to kneel in front of her with both knees earning the ground, then rise from that moment under his own power while her hands came up to meet him. The story carried no hurry in his head, only a timeline that felt right.

"Break," the therapist prompted gently. "Water, then hands again."

Kaela passed the bottle into his palm and let her fingers rest there to comfort him. The contact steadied more than his throat. He drank, wiped chalk along one wrist, and felt a slow heat wake inside tired muscles.

"You look stronger through the hips," she observed. "Your shoulders carry less weight in them."

"Feels that way," he agreed, rolling the word around as if it were a new tool. "The back found its line again. The world looks straighter from up here."

She glanced at the brace and then back at his face. "I can stay through your cooldown and sit by the window after," she offered, voice warm and steady. "We count breaths together, and I keep a hand close if you want it."

"I want that," he returned, setting the bottle on the rail before he squared his shoulders again. "Stay and count with me so this hour turns into something I can carry through the afternoon."

The therapist stepped close enough to show hands, then nodded at the bars. "Reset your stance. Same distance, same pace. Finish the six, then a longer rest."

Joren lifted his right foot and found the mat with the care of a person learning a floor all over again. He kept the screw head in his sight and let the bars become extensions of his arms. The ache through his back pushed against pride, so he fed the ache a number and fed pride a plan. He managed both better when each had a job.

Kaela moved down the rail with him and timed her breath to his count. Her presence filled the gap between fear and courage with a warmth he had lived on since the day they met near a broken panel with live power. She did not coach. She did not cheer. She watched the line of his mouth, the work in his shoulders, the way his right foot hunted and then found confidence. He loved her for that kind of attention.

He paused at the end of the bars and stood tall because standing tall matters even when the room moves a little. His heart tapped hard at the base of his throat, legs humming with effort that promised progress he could measure tomorrow against today, and the brace felt like a firm hand rather than a cage. He looked straight at her and let the wish in his chest turn into words he could own without rushing the life they were building.

\"I carry a picture of our future in my head every hour,\" he ventured, breath steadying as his grip found a calmer hold on the rail. \"I want to arrive there on steps that feel fully mine, with balance I can trust and a back that holds under its own strength.\"

She stepped close without crowding the brace and laid her palm against his cheek, her thumb tracing the line just forward of his ear while her eyes stayed level with his. \"Bring me that day when your steps feel like your steps,\" she murmured, voice warm and sure. \"I will meet you there with both hands, and we will walk the rest together at the pace your body earns.\"

He kissed her then, gentle first and then deeper, because that mix matched the day: careful work, followed by a promise. The therapist looked away with professional grace and checked a chart that did not need checking right this second. Joren let the kiss land and linger, then eased back with his breath running warm and even.

He pictured the corridor with her at his side, the steady lights across the ceiling, the rail markings, and the small wobble at the turn he would learn to smooth on his own. He felt ready to take the next step with her, and he set a quiet rule for himself: that moment arrives when his feet carry him down that hall without braces or bars, with his balance earned and his hand free for hers.

He took the bars again and started the next six with patience and a steady fire. The medical bay carried the sounds of work around him: a cart wheel turning, two voices at a desk, and a cuff releasing air from a forearm. His world narrowed by choice to one line on the wall, two hands on steel, and the woman who waited with a promise he planned to earn.
