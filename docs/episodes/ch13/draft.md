Chapter 13 --- Harvest Line

Deck One carried a busy hum. Couplers clicked into carts. The cage door clanged once and settled. Decon mist left the air with that lemon metal bite Hale always tasted at the back of her throat.

She rolled her shoulders under the vest. Breath in, count to four, breath out. Calm lived in small numbers if you let it.

Nyla stood by the wall map with a slate in one hand, eyes half closed. The ridge grid pulsed in pale lines across the screen, Sector Fourteen bright in the corner. She did not look at the slate.

\"Left ridge. Higher up. Pocket shade.\"

Hale's half grin answered. \"Good. Let them feel seen.\"

Captain Draeven walked the line with his steady launch pace. He handed Hale the mirror tag and tapped the cart latch twice. A clean snap. He nodded once and moved on.

Two Kestrels slid out of the bay with the smooth rise of a crew in rhythm. Hale climbed into the second skimmer, boots set just shy of the bar. She ran gloved fingers along the net bags and felt the weight spread across her palm. Warm, not hot.

\"Check in.\"

\"Two up.\"

\"Cart ready.\"

\"Nyla?\"

\"Two minutes to first pocket. Cart parks short.\"

The skimmers skimmed. Basalt rolled under them like a slow tide turned to stone. Heat shimmer drifted in thin sheets over the ridge lines. Hale watched dust lift and drop from wind that came and went without warning. The smell out here had a dry shell to it, old and clean.

\"Left ridge. Now.\"

The carts angled a few degrees. The team split the arc without being told. Hale set her breath and let the slope fill her eyes. The pocket showed as a darker fold just below the spine of the ridge. The first Kestrel held. The cart stopped short. The cage rattled once as the locks settled.

\"Hold. Watch your footing.\"

Hale stepped off the skimmer. Heat rose like a slow wall, building in layers. Her visor fogged at the seal, cleared. Two posts over, a handler cursed, caught himself, swallowed it. Sweat lined her back under the vest. It did not bother her. The heat felt like a place she knew.

Nyla lifted a hand, palm open. She still had not looked at the slate. Her shoulders set.

\"Stay smooth. Pocket breath in three, two, one.\"

A soft scrape rose from the fold, plates rubbing the faintest edge. Hale moved through it and took her place by the cage. The couplers in her grip felt eager. The pocket rolled, and there it was: the Sunfan's flex and gleam, not dramatic, just a shift like a school of fish inside a shadow.

\"Now.\"

Hale threw the net. The line left her hand with the clean release that means the angle in your head is right. Mesh opened, caught the sweep, settled. A handler slammed the first latch home. Another coupler took. The cage jolted. Heat jumped along the frame.

\"Contact. Frame live.\"

A handler reached for the far bar, hissed, yanked back. A dark print marked his glove.

\"I have it.\"

Hale stepped in, forearms to steel, and took the frame's rise. Metal buzzed through the gloves. Heat pushed at her skin, then lost its edge. Like holding a warm door in summer. Her grip stayed steady. No pain climbed with it. No sting in the wrist where an old scar sometimes woke. Surprise flickered; she set it aside.

\"Cage steady.\"

\"Copy. Cart forward. Do not drag the mesh. Keep it even.\"

The handler with the marked glove moved to the other side and worked the winch. The cart took weight. The frame settled into the mount. Locks clacked in sequence. Hale held until the last light turned green, then lifted clear.

\"Gloves check.\"

Palms up. No shine, no pucker. She flexed once, twice. They felt like her hands.

\"Unmarked.\"

The medic moved on.

\"Pocket rise. Crown drift in five. Do not chase. Wait. Let it roll past.\"

They waited. Heat swelled and slid right in a long slow spill across the ridge. Air shifted with it. Hale could taste the change and could not have said how. Nyla's head turned before the instruments pinged.

\"Turn now.\"

Skimmers swung. The cart followed. The crown rolled where they had been standing. A short laugh slipped out of Hale, half disbelief, half joy. The move felt like stepping aside for a wave that would have broken wrong.

\"Clean exit. Mount up.\"

She climbed back onto the Kestrel. A good ache started in her shoulders where she had taken the frame. She let herself enjoy it for one long breath. The cage hummed on the cart behind them, live but settled. The ridge fell away under their glide. The bay mouth grew from a dark cut to a full gate.

Decon took them in. Curtain, mist, lemon metal that says you made it back, do not bring the outside in. Hale stood still, watched rivulets crawl down her sleeves and fall to the grate in patient lines. Her pulse eased without being told.

\"Intake has the cage.\"

\"Good work.\"

Hale and Nyla stepped aside into the service bay where the air ran cooler along the bulkhead. Hale stripped her gloves and checked again, just to be sure. Still unmarked. Two fingers to the bar. Warm metal. No sting. A breath let out she had not known she was holding.

\"I could have stayed in it. Not smart, but true.\"

Nyla's cheeks were flushed, eyes bright. She drank, leaned her head to the bulkhead, let a quiet laugh escape.

\"I knew where they were before I could say it. A pull in the ribs. Not sound. Not the map. Just there.\"

Hale's smile answered on its own. \"We are getting good at this.\"

\"We are.\"

They bumped shoulders, a small move that felt like a handshake you only learn after you have done something hard together more than once. The bay noise folded around them. For a moment it was just the two of them, the cool metal at their backs, and a current running through their chests that felt a little like pride and a little like relief and a lot like joy.

They walked the short hall to intake. Behind the glass, the cage sat under soft light while a tech checked seals and a nurse read off temperatures in a calm voice. The Sunfan plates were quiet, not dead, more like a cat that had found a warm spot and decided to stay there.

Mira's voice came over the speaker. "Temperature falling. Heartwave shallow and even. Intake to glass in one hour."

The handler with the singed glove held it up. She pointed him to the sinks and a salve. He went, sheepish, grinning like a kid who had touched the stove on purpose.

Hale and Nyla watched a small pulse roll through the lattice and fade. Nyla's shoulders loosened when it passed, as if a knot let go in her back.

"You felt that too."

"Yes. They breathe different when they know they are safe."

A tech waved them through to clear the corridor. They peeled off toward the locker row. Soap, metal, old canvas. Hale dropped her gloves on the bench and tapped a note into the wall tablet: heat above standard, no pain, no blister, hands steady, reported.

Nyla opened her slate and drew three small circles on the ridge map, not where the pings were loudest, but where her hand had gone first. No labels. Just one word beside each: found.

"Water?"

"Please."

Backs to the cool lockers, they passed the bottle between them. The vents hummed. The sound smoothed the edges of the day.

Hale tipped her head to the ceiling grid. "I thought the climb would scare me, the part where the heat does not stop."

"Does it?"

\"Not today. It felt normal. Hot, but fine.\"

Nyla let out a short laugh. \"Do not tell the pilots. They will not shut up about it.\"

\"They already do not shut up. Keep it out of the ready room.\"

A chime marked shift change on the far side of the wall. The door swung once and settled. Boots faded down the hall.

Nyla leaned a shoulder into Hale. "Next run, first minute with my eyes closed. I want to see if I can point the pocket without looking."

"That sounds like a dare you already won."

"I need to be sure. If I make it a trick in my head, it stops working."

"Do it small. First minute only. Call it, then check."

A nod. "Small is good."

They finished the water and stood. Hale slid the gloves into her bin and shut it with a clean smack. Nyla tucked the slate under her arm and let out the breath she had been holding since the ridge.

A family moved past, voices low, the way people talk when they are trying not to look. A kid at the end turned and stared anyway at the cart tracks and the wet prints from decon. Hale flashed two fingers. He lit up, did it back, then hurried after his people.

"That used to be me."

"It is still you. Just with better boots."

They stopped at the bay door window. The ridge line cut a hard pencil mark against the pale. Sun sat low over the basalt. A thin dust line traced the path they had cut. It already looked old.

The good ache in Hale's forearms softened into warmth under the ribs. No word for it that did not sound like bragging. No need for one. Nyla stood there too, seeing the same horizon with the same quiet pride.

"Food?"

"Food. Then sleep for ten years."

"Two hours. You can have two."

"Two it is. I will take them."

They turned from the window. As they walked, Hale hooked her little finger through Nyla's for one step. A small squeeze back. No words. No ceremony. Just a shared moment that said, we did it, we will do it again, we will bring each other home.
