Chapter 45 --- Work That Carries

Range Two held even light and clean lines. Plates stacked in neat columns beside a steel rack. Sleds lined the far wall with their tow straps coiled flat. A padded bench sat square on rubber tile. Two tripods stood folded like careful tools. The air smelled like oil, cold metal, and the faint bite that follows a morning's wipe-down. Dax set his Longcoil case by the door, looked over the room the way a rigger looks over a span, and let his shoulders loosen one notch because the day could pay him back for a long list of aches.

Rane walked the perimeter once with that slow hand-check she did before any work, not superstitious, just thorough. A technician keyed up the board for "Load Suite Bench, Phase One" and announced the sequence without theater. Elias watched from behind glass with a clipboard and one elbow perched on the counter. A medic team checked cuffs, cuffs again, and the cooldown kit that lived ready on a cart. The panel for Dax's suite sat on his belt like a quiet promise: bone density up, tendon reinforcement live, joint shear reduced across the chain.

Dax rolled his neck and listened to each small answer inside the joints. Nothing creaked. Nothing grabbed. The bones felt heavier in a way that pleased him. Density without stubbornness. He lifted his arms and let them drop. The shoulders met the sockets with a calm that felt earned. He grinned once, small and private, thinking about the cost of new uniforms. The same jacket closed on the same set of buttons. Good. He preferred to spend his credits on tools and food.

Rane stepped into his line. "We build from the ground up," she briefed. "Feet, hips, grip. Plates first, then sled, then tools. You find the edges by feel, not by pride. When the panel says taper, we taper. When the room grants a push, we push."

"Copy," Dax returned, then caught himself and finished the way he meant to live. "Understood. I work the plan."

He started with plates to wake the chain. Two hands under a single forty-five, then two plates together with a clean dead-hang. He felt the weight sit deeper along the ulna than last week and travel into the shoulder without the old spark that used to light up behind the collarbone. He held the plates for a ten-count, set them down, breathed, and repeated with an angle change. Grip held steady. The small muscles at the elbow hummed without heat.

The rack carried a bar with staging pins set at mid-thigh. Dax loaded a simple ladder: one plate a side, then two, then three. On the first pull he felt the new suite answer along the line from heel to hand. The bar came steady with no hitch through the sticking point that used to punish him when sleep had run thin. He set the bar down by inches the way good shops teach, not by drop. He rested, loaded again, and climbed the ladder until the rubber tile voiced a slight complaint under his boots. Rane lifted a palm. He froze the plates there for a ten-count, then stripped them in reverse and let blood return to skin.

"Feel," she prompted.

"Weight sits closer to bone," he evaluated. "Hands do less theater. Hips accept the hand-off without bargaining. Shoulders stay out of the argument."

Rane nodded once. "Sled," she instructed, and the technician rolled over the first one.

The sled weighed heavy empty. Dax clipped the tow strap across his hips, leaned into a forward pull, and let his feet bite the tile like a man who learned his footing on metal stairs in a wet winter. He took the first ten meters slow and honest. The drag felt like a handshake with an old friend who brought a better mood than last time. He walked the sled around the mark and brought it back, then waved for plates. The tech added two forty fives. Dax walked again. Breathing stayed easy. The strap bit into the hip bone and then settled as the load met the new reinforcement there and spread across tendon and fascia with a wider stance.

He traded sled for yoke and walked a short farmer's carry with two heavy handles. Each arm took its share without begging the spine for charity. On the third trip he accelerated for five steps and then stopped clean without wobble. He had always loved this kind of math: distance, time, mass, rhythm. A man could hide pride inside numbers less than inside stories.

Elias keyed the mic. "Shoulders?" he checked.

"Feels like I traded rust for grease," Dax replied, then smiled because the metaphor tasted too slick in his mouth. "Feels like the chain accepts the load and pays it forward."

"Good," Elias returned, and ticked a box.

Rane moved him to the rack with the heavy bag. He hugged the bag and walked a square, set it down, spun it, and hugged it again. The suite held his breath steady. The small muscles along the spine lit like a line of clean bulbs: alive, even, low. He tipped the bag up and caught it on one shoulder. The old flare at the acromion did not arrive. He rotated left to right and back again, testing the cuff. The tendons read solid and fast.

"Tripod," Rane directed, and the technician wheeled over a folded unit with a long, lidded case riding shotgun.

Dax unfolded the tripod and locked the legs out by click and feel. He drove the feet into the tile and checked level by eye. The lidded case opened to a machine gun with the grace of a small bridge. He had mounted these beasts to deck plates and dune skiffs and rubble piles with sandbags that stank of old cordite. He had never shouldered one on a floor and walked with it for distance. That had been a young man's dream and an old man's caution. Today lived in between, which felt right.

He lifted the gun off the case and let the weight settle along both forearms. The grip sat honest in his hands. The balance felt forward-heavy by design. He brought it to waist height and held it for a count. Then he raised it to collarbone and found the pocket where stock met meat without hammering bone. The suite answered along the chain with a quiet firmness that surprised him with its calm. The muzzle did not wobble. The shoulders did not bark. The hands did not flutter for purchase. He exhaled and settled the barrel on the lane.

"Dry drill first," Rane briefed. "Mount, sweep, mount again. Then we run a short belt at low cadence for rhythm."

He mounted. He swept. He mounted again. He made each motion slow and clean. He let the stock tuck. He let the elbows find the line that keeps recoil inside a cage instead of in the face. Memory from barricade days returned, then updated itself on the fly as the suite gave him more room to place force exactly where he wanted it. He liked that word today: room. The new body did not make him reckless. It gave him room to choose.

"Live," Rane called.

The tech fed a short belt and stepped clear. Dax breathed, set the trigger, and coached the weapon through its rhythm the way a rigger brings a heavy line through a fairlead: steady and honest. Three-round puffs. Pause. Adjust. Three-round puffs. The butt stayed planted. The shoulder stayed friendly. The barrel climbed a little and then returned where he coaxed it. He did not chase the rise. He worked the line back. Ten bursts later the belt tail slapped the side plate and hung there empty like a flag losing wind.

Elias watched his color and the small numbers for cuff heat and spine shear. Everything looked clean. He wrote one line: "Load lives where it belongs."

Rane signaled the sled again. "Carry," she ordered. "Cross the room with it. Back and forth for two minutes."

Dax took the big gun to port arms and walked a neat rectangle around cones someone had placed years ago and never moved. The old strain in the long head of the biceps did not lift its ugly face. The trap did not cramp. He felt the new density as a quiet ballast that turned wobble into line. He reached the mark, pivoted, and returned. He kept the muzzle down range for habit and respect. Two minutes ended like a well-cut rope: square and satisfying.

He set the gun on the case and rolled his shoulders. The room answered with the quiet found in shops during good work. Rane looked at Elias. Elias lifted two fingers. Rane nodded.

"Graduate the load," she instructed, and the technician wheeled out a second case with a different kind of presence.

The Kestrel skiff mount lay inside like a sleeping engine, all barrel and cooling jacket and feed tray big enough to serve a meal. Dax had manned it in crosswinds that made folk swear and kneel. He had broken down jammed links with a Leatherman while sand hunted the whites of his eyes. He respected the weapon. He had also learned how it punished shoulders that took it personal.

"Dry mount, then short belt," Rane briefed. "We measure time, not heroics. The goal lives in clean handling for one hour. We stop early if the panel turns sour or if the weld behind your eyes starts to spit."

Dax stepped into the weight the way a man steps through a doorway he has walked a hundred times: no ceremony, no apology. He lifted the weapon, let it settle across the bones of both forearms, then drew it into his right shoulder and found that pocket again. The barrel felt longer than his patience on some days. Today it felt like a test he had studied for. He mounted, sighted on a center panel that had been shot into a pleasant ruin by people he respected, and held the line.

The first belt ran at a measured pace. He took three-round bursts, then five, and watched the sights return because he asked them to, not because they felt like it. The suite returned each small tremor to zero in less space than his old frame could manage. Heat bled through metal into the air. Oil scent rose and built a memory of long nights that now tasted less bitter.

The clock ticked. Rane broke the hour into pieces that did not insult a man with sugar. Ten minutes on the mount with a belt every other minute. Two minutes cradle and carry, then back up. The medic checked his color and nail beds at each pause. Elias watched the cuff numbers and the neck line. Dax worked through the hour with the patience of a shop that believes in first-pass quality: no yank, no rush, only the good tempo.

At minute thirty, the old ache that used to perch on the ridge of his scapula tried to remind him that bodies lie when pride talks. The suite met that ache with a broad support that took the knife out of its hand. He adjusted his elbows by a thumb's width and let his breath run on a four-count. The ache agreed to a truce. He did not grin this time. He respected the negotiation and kept the gun steady.

At minute forty, sweat made his forearms slick. He chalked. The chalk settled into a clean layer. The weapon shifted once, a quarter inch over the bone, and then stayed where he told it to stay. He brought the tail of the belt over by memory and fed it smooth so the tray teeth never bit down on a bad loop.

At minute fifty, he reminded himself he loved simple math: ten more minutes, two belts, one clean carry. He brought the gun off the mount for a short lap around the cones to prove the suite under motion. The muzzle swayed a little, then corrected with a small hip move he had used on ladders. He reached the mark, pivoted, returned, and mounted again.

At minute sixty, Rane raised a hand. "Set down," she called.

He lowered the Kestrel weapon to the case and let his arms hang for a breath. He rolled his shoulders, waiting for the old spark. Nothing answered. The muscles read tired in the honest way, not the angry way. His breathing eased quickly. The panel on his belt showed a calm line on joint heat and a minor bump at the right wrist that nobody worried about.

Rane stepped in. "Your hour," she recognized, and placed a palm against the barrel shroud for one second in a gesture that meant something to people who have carried weight together.

"Felt like a fair day's pull," Dax measured, voice steady. "I remembered to keep the gun as a tool, not a grudge. The suite gives room, and room keeps temper out of the work."

Elias came through the door with his clipboard under one arm and a bottle of water in the other. "Numbers hold," he reported. "Cuff strain reads lower than last month by a good margin. Spine shear stays inside our comfort. Shoulder chain looks honest. You earned protein, salt, and an early pillow."

Dax drank half the bottle and set it on the case. He tested the shoulder by lifting his arm straight overhead and making a small circle. The joint answered with the smooth whisper of good bearings. He liked that image and kept it, even while he did not push images around much. A man could allow himself one small joke. "Still the same jacket," he told Rane, tugging the lapel. "Tailor keeps sleeping well."

"Good," Rane returned. "I prefer budgets for gear, not closets."

The technician reset the room for the next cycle. Rane led Dax to the sled again for a short cool-down pull. He walked it like a farmer bringing in a gate before night. The strap bit, then stopped biting, then read like a line into the body rather than across it. He liked that more than he expected.

They ended on the bench with a slow stretch. The suite let muscles lengthen without argument. Ate-old knots loosened under his thumbs. He braced a foot on the frame, twisted, and felt the good ache that writes, "go eat." Rane watched the stretch with an eye for corners people miss, and she nudged a heel into better line with two fingers. It was the kind of coaching that never made noise and always paid off in rooms that punished slop.

"Talk me through the heavy tools," she requested when his breath settled. "What changes first in a long day, and what changes last."

"First change lives in the grip," he answered, thinking it through. "I hold shape longer without asking forearms to scream. Second change sits in the shoulder chain. The small stabilizers keep their promises when the big parts start to complain. Last change shows in hips. Carry stance stays honest after the third hour. That keeps knees from playing lawyer."

"Good," she concluded. "You teach that to Joren when he steps back on the floor. He trusts your math."

"I will bring him a pack for the third lap," Dax replied, a dry curl at the corner of his mouth. "He keeps the first two for free."

Rane gave him a look that counted as a smile in her book. "Hale already promised to count the marks," she reminded. "Do not let her steal the easy job."

"She can have the counting," he returned. "I will bring the weight."

They moved to the weapons locker for the last drill: carry and set. The tripod came out first. Dax shouldered it like a ladder and walked the cones, then set it on the line and locked the feet without stomping. He lifted the Kestrel once more for a final mount, not to fire, just to practice that smooth rise and seat. The movement felt like drawing a blueprint inside his bones. He liked that feeling. A plan that lived in the body meant less talk and fewer mistakes.

He broke the gun down on the bench and cleaned it with a care that came from old habits rather than inspection. A man who respects tools makes fewer widows. He wiped the feed tray, checked the pawls, and ran a cloth through the receiver until it came out only faintly grey. He stacked the parts with the same order every time. Order kept weight light.

Elias signed the sheet and handed it to Rane. "Two days, then next block," he mapped. "We will add an uneven surface and a carry under light smoke. No hero metrics. Only clean work."

"I like that phrase," Dax offered. "No hero metrics. Put it on a sign."

"I will put it on your slate," Elias replied, which served the same purpose.

They filed out of Range Two. The corridor light felt a touch warmer, or maybe the blood in Dax's shoulders told him stories that matched how he wanted a day to end. He lifted the Longcoil case and felt it as little more than a briefcase now, which could turn a man foolish if he let it. He did not plan to let it. He walked with Rane toward the mess.

On the way they passed the medical bay. Through the window, he saw Joren on parallel bars with Kaela at his elbow and a nurse with a hand near the panel. Joren moved slow and even, then paused, then took a step that looked like a promise. Dax touched the glass with two fingertips in a quick salute that belonged to those who keep the shop open for each other. He did not knock. He moved on, because a person does not turn someone else's hard hour into his own scene.

In the mess, he found Hale already working through a tray of roasted vegetables and a slab of protein that had seen fire the way it should. He set his tray across from her, eased down without a wince, and raised an eyebrow.

"Did the room treat you fair," he asked.

"It did," she replied. "My hands learned to wait for the picture. The picture learned to show up on time."

He forked a piece of meat and chewed, then pointed the fork at the air as if marking a spot on a drawing. "Strength feels different now that it costs less," he reflected. "It used to come out of a jar labeled 'pay later.' Today it came from a shelf that holds what I put there."

"That line will teach," she suggested. "Use it when you talk to him."

"I will," he confirmed, and let the warmth of satisfaction settle without making a speech out of it.

Rane joined them with a short list for tomorrow and the next day. Elias passed the door with his clipboard and paused long enough to tilt it in Dax's direction in a gesture that counted, then kept going because the lab always called him in the early evening. The ship kept its rhythm. Tools returned to racks. Boots traveled the same marks they had traveled yesterday and would travel tomorrow. Inside the rhythm, Dax felt the suite find its home: not as a party trick, not as a loud story, but as work that carries and then carries some more without asking for blood in return.

He finished his plate, drank his water, and stood. The shoulders told him a truth that made him like the day even more: no hot spots, no angry lines, no quiet threats. He flexed his fingers once and watched the knuckles roll under skin that looked the same as it had last week. He smiled again, that small private one, thinking of the quartermaster yawning through another watch without measuring him for larger sleeves.

"Same jacket," he murmured, just loud enough for Hale to hear.

"Same job," she returned.

He nodded and headed for the showers. Tomorrow would bring anchors for Joren and a fresh block for Hale. The day after would bring uneven ground and smoke. He planned to meet each hour with the same shop-floor patience that had carried him this far. Dense bone, steady tendon, and a line of math he trusted: weight times distance, counted with breath, delivered with hands that knew when to stop.
