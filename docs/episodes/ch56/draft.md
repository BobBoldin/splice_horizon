**Chapter 56: Two Distractions**

Midday heat pressed down on the ship\'s concourse. Schedules held through lunch, then cracked in two places at once. A brawl broke out outside the Greenlight Bar when a loader threw a line about jump-the-queue pilots. A bottle shattered against a bollard and three men squared off with two more. Shouts carried across the lane. Someone blew a whistle and someone else rang an old bell from a hook on the door. The sound drew a crowd faster than any memo.

Captain Draeven arrived with Seargent Hale and Private Joren Calrix while two dock officers tried to separate shoulders with open hands. The bar's door stood half open. The smell of yeast and old citrus hung in the heat. Boots scraped on the grit. A woman in an apron pointed at a bleeding knuckle and demanded a cleanup before she let anyone back inside.

"Masks up," Hale instructed the closest pair. "Gloves on. Set a safety boundary from the post to the rail and keep it there."

Joren snapped two cones down and ran a tape line. He spoke to the nearest group with a steady voice that carried across moving air. "Step back two paces. Give them room. No one needs a broken wrist today."

A loader in a blue cap pushed against the tape. "Pilots cut our slot," he argued. "We lose hours when they do that."

A pilot with a book of receipts lifted his chin. "Your manager reassigned lanes and logged it late," he countered. "Do not pin that on me."

Draeven moved between the two and kept his tone calm. "Listen up. Your beef runs through the office, not across a curb. Keep the hands down and keep the faces clean. You will both make your case when the steward arrives."

The steward came sweating and frustrated, then wrote names into a book that displayed stamped boxes: warning, fine, hold. He marked warning for both sides, then raised his voice for the crowd. "We are not closing the bar and we are not closing lanes. Clear out and let the officers mop this blood."

The crowd dispersed in knots. Hale checked the man with the bleeding knuckle for fractures and taped a split. Joren helped a dishwasher rinse glass into a bucket. The apron woman nodded once when the walkway looked decent again.

An hour later, a protest ignited under the west gantry where water restrictions had tightened again. Signs lifted: noon line for clinics only; family allotments tomorrow; no credit at the side window. A foreman with a tired face tried to explain the schedule. Twenty people booed and three old men began to chant about the Compact and the rights of households. The chant pulled more bodies toward the gantry.

Dax and two officers formed a loose line with plastic shields. Hale took a bullhorn and set a clear, even cadence. "Keep it peaceful and keep the route open. Clinics receive noon deliveries. House allotments post at fourteen hundred. That is the schedule on the board."

A woman with a baby on her hip argued through the noise. "My kid takes a nap at noon," she complained. "You want me to wait under this bridge in full sun."

Mira, who had come down from her checks with the clinic liaison, stepped to the front. She spoke evenly into the bullhorn. "Use the shade under the cargo stairs," she offered. "The line manager will mark your place. I will bring a stack of numbers and a pen. Each of you will keep your order without standing in heat."

The crowd paused, then settled as the liaison walked down with a clipboard and a sleeve of numbered tags. People shifted left to the shade. A boy ran two numbers back to friends with a small smile. Shoulders lowered. Voices dropped to a level that registered as normal.

Through both events the Custodian watched from a window three floors up. His clerk moved slips through a slot and received vouchers with a practiced hand. The man looked relaxed because he had planned this pace. He had placed the dock brawl where it would draw wardens and officers. He had fed the protest with fresh notices that tightened rules by a hair and displayed at the wrong hour. The two flare-ups held attention exactly where he wanted it held.

He played them like a first chair can play the violin, with precision so sharp it cut through their defenses, each note a manipulation, each pause a trap.

In the lanes behind the bonded warehouse, two couriers in grey smocks moved a dull crate between pallets of fittings. A supervisor checked a tag, then waved them through a side roll-up that never stood open without a reason. Inside the shade of the bay, three cases of coupler cartridges sat on a pallet marked tool consumables. The labels displayed maintenance stock codes. The scan registered a match and the pallet rolled to a private lift with a simple bump of a wheel.

The cases held thanatium-enhanced vials. The mix would slot into coupler ports with the same click as a basic series pack. The change would register as a standard model number to a lazy scan. A careful scan would note a serial range out of sequence, but no one careful stood near that lift today. The pallet dropped two levels. A quiet truck took the cargo toward a gate that faced the old freight road.

Draeven did not see the pallet leave. He was at the west gantry with a water officer and a steward, keeping a thin line between protest and a push. Hale had moved three families under a strip of shade and handed them cold packs from a cooler. Dax tracked the tension through the crowd and spoke to a pair of men who wanted to turn yelling into shoving. Joren repaired a broken stanchion base with a new bolt so the line stayed straight and honest. Order returned by degrees. Calm held.

When the wardens reached the operations office in early evening, Colvern held a paper with a slow thumb. The header showed a procurement shell, plain font, and a stamp that displayed a broker's clearing mark. The top of the page listed standard, legal items that would flood a market and drop prices: "life extension routine, basic; libido stabilizer, retail pack; metabolic recovery kits; stamina taper modules; cognitive clarity strips." Each entry showed unit counts and a low-priority delivery window. The sheet was a sales plan for anyone who wanted cheaper upgrades and fewer questions.

She turned the page. The second sheet carried variants and margin notes: bulk volumes, regional pricing, a packaged series for clinics. It looked like a prospectus meant to reassure stewards. It was the kind of list that let a regulator feel in control.

"You will take this as evidence that he is planning to flood the market," she observed, laying the pages flat. "Cheap goods. High volume. Legitimate lines with clean invoices."

Draeven leaned over the table and scanned the numbers. "A fifty percent price drop will drown a black market in legal product," he noted. "That buys him cover. People buy the cheap, legal stuff first and do not look for the other line."

Colvern tapped the last page with a fingernail. "That is their story," she returned. "It is tidy and it reduces heat. It also gives him a ledger that looks honest when inspectors check."

Draeven weighed the numbers, then nodded once. "We treat it as a breadcrumb," he concluded. "Pull camera on bonded lanes and the service lift. Cross the beacon pings from levels two and three. Match voucher fonts against yesterday's set. Request serial ranges for tool consumables and look for gaps."

Hale slid the packet into a sleeve. "We keep our timing boundary," she added. "We log each step, store the footage, and move without noise."

Dax marked a checklist on his tablet. "Angles, logs, and the old-badge roster," he recapped. "Add pallet scales near the private roll-up. If weight swings outside tolerance, we flag it."

Joren pointed to the board. "We also want dock clock drift," he proposed. "If a lane clock runs slow by a minute, a crate can pass during a false window."

Colvern noted each item with neat strokes. "I will request tag histories for the lift bay," she offered. "We compare maintenance entries against real work orders. Any tag with a new sticker and no matching task gets a circle."

They broke the table and moved. The corridor carried foot traffic, warm air, and the faint bite of citrus cleaner. A forklift beeped near the far loading door. The office hum registered as normal. None of it displayed the other hand at work.

Hale split the team. Dax and Joren pulled the camera reels. Draeven walked the bonded lanes with a steward and a quiet pen. Colvern drafted the first letters to operations. Mira sent a note to the clinic liaison to hold noon receipts for serial checks. They worked the list without speeches, each piece in its place.

Across the port, behind tinted glass, the Custodian reviewed a copy of the same brochure and laughed under his breath. The sheet listed safe volume that any regulator could bless: life extension basic, libido stabilizers, cognitive clarity strips, metabolic recovery kits, stamina tapers. Unit counts ran high. Delivery windows displayed as modest. The package would flood shelves and drown questions.

He opened a thin folder that never touched a public ledger. The paper inside carried the line items that built leverage rather than cover. He ran a finger down the list and measured margins while the floor below went about its evening.

"Pheromone expression suite," he read quietly. "Tunable output for negotiation rooms. Short half-life. No residue. Ship in blister cards labeled aroma modulators. Include a diffuser shell for meetings that need a bump."

He turned the page. "Detection avoidance package. Thief-class. Mask common biometrics and distort gait checks. Scramble basic lens capture within posted limits. Sell a premium variant that defeats standard gate arrays." A margin note set quantities, carriers, and two dummy consignees with clean names.

He continued without flourish. "Coagulation toxin line. No-sting contact route. Onset selectable by selector wheel. Reversal available on contract for premium clients." He underlined the clause that required a small audit kit for the buyer who feared his own purchase.

He paused, then added the working lot that was already moving. "Coupler vials with thanatium trace. Compatible with standard ports. Serial ranges concealed by packaging codes. Move as tool consumables." He stacked a second sheet behind it that assigned pallets to a night window and a quiet gate.

He played them like a first chair can play the violin, with precision so sharp it cut through their defenses, each note a manipulation, each pause a trap.

A discrete chime registered on his private console. The message displayed a clean header and a clipped tone.

"Delivery confirmed," Cold Mother wrote. "No time to congratulate yourself. Procure prototypes for the next set immediately. Keep paper careful. Feed the right stewards. Avoid glamour. You are valuable while you remain ordinary."

He closed the message and began to draft orders with a pencil and a steady wrist. Public items moved first: a large life-extension lot to three storefronts, two pallets of libido lines to a distributor with spotless audits, and a modest run of cognitive strips to a clinic chain that liked neat invoices. Those orders would register as progress and keep inspectors proud of their own pace.

Then he laid the real pipeline. He wrote a purchase for the pheromone suite with parts that could pass as ambient scent cartridges. He assigned the thief package to a shell that paid on thirty-day terms and always cleared at day twenty-nine. He marked the toxin line for a buyer who required no lecture and paid in quiet increments. He set coupler vials to ride inside a crate of fittings with a weight that matched the manifest.

He added carriers, seals, and people. A night truck to the old freight road. A warehouse clerk with an old badge and a clean collar. A union steward who liked a small favor at the end of a long day. A printer who kept two fonts in a drawer and only reached for the wrong one when asked by a friend.

Back in operations, Draeven and Colvern reviewed the first pulls. A camera angle displayed the private lift during the crowd-control window. Beacon logs registered two pings that did not match lane assignments. Voucher copies displayed one stamp with a font that was observed to be off by a hair. The gaps did not prove the hand. They showed its outline.

Hale aligned the next steps. "We file what we can prove," she concluded. "We request the contractor list with old badges and put eyes on those doors at change of shift. We install scales where weight tells more truth than a sticker."

Dax added two counters to the board. "We deploy portable air samplers in negotiation rooms," he proposed. "If pheromone loads hit above baseline, we want a number. We brief security to watch for gate defeats that trip half alarms."

Mira logged clinic serials and set a clean drawer for any coupler lot that felt wrong in the hand. Joren mapped clock drift against the schedule and circled the lane with the widest tolerance. Colvern prepared a quiet packet for stewards who valued facts over theater. None of it touched the man behind the tinted glass. All of it tightened the room where he worked.

The Custodian finished his orders and closed the folder. The public brochure would keep inspectors busy and proud. The private list would keep customers close and quiet. Trucks would move while the wardens sifted cameras and vouchers. He checked his watch, capped his pencil, and slid the folder into a drawer that locked with a simple key.

In the ready room, Draeven capped a marker and stepped back from the board. "We stay neat," he concluded. "Metal, paper, people. We pick one thread tonight and we pull until it gives." The team gathered their notes and moved toward the door. Outside, the port settled into evening traffic and steady noise. The next window waited on the clock.
