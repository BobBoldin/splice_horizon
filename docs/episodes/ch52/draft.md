Chapter 52 --- The Long Talk

Elias worked the quiet hour in orbital care and let the room settle. Monitors kept a steady pace, and the window framed Megnar with its pale flats and hard ridges. He lifted the comm when Kaela's light blinked and felt the knot in his chest loosen the way it always does when her face fills the screen.

"You catch a calm shift," she opened, eyes bright. "Hydro ran smooth, and the towers liked their feed."

"They looked strong on the last check," he replied, warmth in his voice. "Muniz built them like a man who trusts water to choose the right path, and your roots helped."

She smiled and set her pen behind her ear. "That tray behaved for once," she teased. "I brought him the thick lace and kept the thin out of his way."

They let an easy silence sit for a breath. He watched her posture, the small tilt of her head, and the way she keeps focus gentle and direct. Family lives in those small shapes.

"I saw Joren's rehab clip this morning," he shared. "He took the turn like a man who owns the floor."

"He earns that stride every day," she returned, pride softening her voice. "We walked the corridor after lunch and counted marks together. He kept pace even when the pack wanted to tell its own story."

Elias turned the cup in his hands, then placed it aside. "I spoke with Director Colvern at midday," he began, choosing steadier words. "Her brief on the new work opened a door I want you to see. It touches the future we only hint at, and I want the choice to sit with you, not with my worries."

Kaela leaned closer, curiosity warm rather than sharp. "Tell me the steps," she invited. "I like steps more than headlines."

"Colvern's team believes a careful trace of Thanatium can help us lock Spiral inheritance," he explained. "We would pair it with our cleanest base mesh and a tight safety boundary. The goal reads simple on paper: a genome that passes to your children without the fault line that shaped your childhood. The price lives on a form rather than in a scar. You would sign a fresh twenty-five years as duty and research partner. That line keeps your work and your life aboard this hull."

She listened without flinching. Her hands folded, then opened, then stilled. "You carry Earth in your definition of home," she observed, gentle as a hand on a shoulder. "My compass points here. Meridian feeds us, keeps us warm, gives us work, and holds our days together. Twenty-five years feels like life, not penalty. I built my plans inside these corridors, and I do not look back over my shoulder when I use the word home."

He let out a slow breath and felt gratitude wash behind his ribs. "Hearing that helps me sort the pictures in my head," he offered. "I still smell my father's shop when I say home. You hear air systems and voices on C-deck. Both versions carry truth. I will learn your version with more care."

"You want a clean line for our family," she continued, reading his face the way she reads a panel. "You picture grandchildren who start life without heat tallies and clinic sheets. You want me to age without yearly Sunfan windows and the guesswork they invite."

"I do," he answered, steady and warm. "Sunfan with the base mesh keeps you healthy through a yearly tune, and the heat we manage sits inside known limits. Biology writes new notes every year, though, and good tools deserve a backup plan. The new work offers that plan. I bring it to you as a door with a handle, not a rule with a stamp."

She let the planet glow on the edge of the screen and held his eyes. "Joren and I have not set a date," she reminded, tone calm. "We share a hope for children and a patience that keeps hope kind. I love that you bring this to me early, and I welcome the clarity. I also love simple evenings where the biggest choice is stew or noodles. We will place big decisions on a clear table, and we will pick them up when both hearts and calendars agree."

"Stew wins the vote for sleep," he offered, letting a grin break through. "I can live with noodles on weekends."

She laughed, then lifted her chin. "How would the work begin," she asked, "if I choose that door after the wedding and the first quiet season with him?"

"We start with blood and a fresh read," he mapped, keeping each step human. "We clear your schedule and time the first dose after a week that treats you kindly. We prime with the new coupler and ride a safety boundary as tight as a hair. Three monitors watch, four hands hover, and we count hours together. The first month belongs to rest, food, and walks near Hydro because green helps patience grow. After that month, we test for clean lines. If the panel reads the way Colvern expects, we retire Sunfan from your yearly calendar and keep only a light midyear check. When you and Joren choose a path toward children, we run inheritance panels again and talk through each result like family, not lab and subject."

Her face softened in a way that always pulls a sting from his day. "I hear care in every step," she replied. "I hear room for life between the steps. That balance matters as much as the science."

He placed his palm on the counter and leaned closer to the lens, as if one inch more could carry weight across distance. "I will never push you," he promised, voice quiet and firm. "I will carry knowledge, not demands. I will also hold the picture of a child who carries your smile and Joren's patience, and I will keep that picture on a high shelf until you tell me to take it down."

"Good," she returned, eyes bright with humor and love. "Dust the shelf once a week and keep your hands busy with towers and valves. We will bring you a date when our feet feel steady in the same hour. Bigger news will arrive when the time tastes right."

A nurse leaned into his view and lifted two fingers toward Bay Three. He nodded thanks, then looked back at Kaela. "One cuff asks for a new battery," he shared, warmth still in his tone. "Before I go, I want to talk about small plans, so your mother gets to fuss with purpose. Dax has a table in progress that refuses to wobble. Hale promised beans and a story that names no one. Rane will pretend to care only about rosters, then ask which cake travels well. Pick a corner you love for a small gathering. Pick music that keeps conversation easy. I will bring tea worthy of your day."

She shook her head, smiling wide now. "We will keep it simple and clean," she answered. "A corner near the view, a table that holds, and a cake that forgives gravity. The rest can grow in its own time. Tell mom I claim first look at any banner she tries to smuggle onto the wall."

"She will hear it from me," he replied, joy flickering through his voice. "She will pretend to argue and then agree, which counts as teamwork after this many years."

Kaela lifted her hand toward the screen, and he mirrored the gesture. The small ritual carried light across the gap as surely as any shuttle.

"I love you," she offered, plain and full. "Thank you for bringing hard ideas with soft hands."

"I love you," he returned, heart steady. "Thank you for trusting me with your time, your health, and your future. I will keep both pockets ready, one for today and one for tomorrow."

The alert chimed again, polite rather than urgent. He lifted his eyes toward Bay Three and then back to her. "Go rest those eyes," he urged. "Dream of clear halls and steady steps. I will finish this shift and bring your mother tea that tastes like memory rather than disinfectant."

"I will hold you to that," she replied, laughing. "And father, keep the wedding and children on that high shelf for now. We will name dates and futures when we earn them. For tonight, we eat noodles."

"Enjoy every bite," he answered, the grin returning. "Stew can win tomorrow."

The screen dimmed. Elias washed his hands and crossed to Bay Three, lighter by a measure he could feel in his shoulders. He changed a battery, tightened a strap, and watched a neat line take shape. The ship worked around him with its steady music: towers trickled, stills rattled, pumps on the flats threw clean gallons into tanks, and Wardens kept their circle tight against weather and men. He stood a moment at the viewport, measured the curve of Megnar, and placed two futures back on their shelf with care. Then he turned toward the next patient and the next task, grateful for a family that meets hard choices with warm voices and long plans.
