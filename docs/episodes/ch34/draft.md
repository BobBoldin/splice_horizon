Chapter 34 --- A Door with Two Handles

They brought Linda Marris through the payroll corridor because that hallway reads as routine, and Draeven wanted the cameras to register a normal consult on hours and forms. Hale carried bland folders with vendor stamps on the covers, and Dax walked two paces behind with a neutral face and empty hands. The room felt like a training space: steady office light, three chairs, a plain table, a pitcher of water with two clean cups, and a wall screen parked on a harmless menu. Halden monitored from operations with a fresh log open, and the door latched with a soft click that kept nerves steady.

Linda took the chair across from Draeven and kept both hands tight on her bag strap. Color held at her mouth while her cheeks paled under the freckle line, so Hale poured water before anyone opened a folder. She wore a plain work shirt and a straight badge, hair braided in a mirror that allowed one quick pass and no polish. Her breath came short through the nose, then evened as the glass touched her lip.

"Thank you for coming," Draeven opened, voice pitched for paperwork. "This is a shift-bonus audit with vendor reconciliation, and your logs appear on two receiving runs under review for timing." He placed a folder in front of her and let the checklist speak for itself. "This work keeps the ship accurate, and it comes with a credit once we finish."

Linda touched the folder with one fingertip, then wrapped the strap again. "Am I under arrest," she asked, steady and direct.

"This is a routine check in a standard room," Draeven answered. "Open space, open hands, and quiet at the end of the hall." He poured a second glass and slid it across. "Drink."

She lifted the cup with both hands and took a measured sip, and the tremor of fear starting by the second swallow. She looked at Hale with a tearful, small glance that carried more story than a badge line. "I know why I\'m here. You found the extra halves," she ventured. "Before you even ask, I can\'t help you! The Custodian would have me killed. I\'m probably dead either way.\" Her tears were apparent to everyone in the room now. \"His file might read like he is a clerk; but he is a pure monster. His senses are beyond human, nobody knows if it was purely by chance or what but he has spliced without showing any negative effects. He hears a heartbeat change pace from across a room, and he calls it before the person feels it. He smells fresh sweat the moment it breaks along the brow. When he looks at you, thoughts feel exposed, and your mouth tries to keep up with what he already read. You might think you are simply doing your job. But you have to know, you\'ve killed me and likely my son too. If we are to live to see next week you must let me go, please I\'m begging you."

Hale folded her hands where Linda could see them. "You entered here for inventory training and a shift-bonus sign-off," she explained. "Your badge reflects training, your payroll slip shows the credit, and your name rides a list with six others from other decks. Anyone who checks will see the same, plus a schedule note requesting care hours for your boy."

Linda pulled breath through her dripping nose and held the air long enough to keep her voice from completely breaking. "He hears a watch tick inside a sleeve," she went on. "He catches a coin against fabric and a shoe that squeaks once every step. He chooses people who work for children and schedules. When you brought me here, a line snapped across my chest."

\"My son,\" she sobbed, mouth tightening on the last word before she steadied herself. \"We sign for twenty-five years, and housing and meals come with the work, but clinic care still runs on credits and schedule slots. His father died of the Spiral last year, and the staff keeps telling me early intervention stays within reach if I keep us near the front of the line. I picked up extra shifts to earn clinic credits and protect our care block, then a quiet voice offered small favors for small moves. I told myself I was only steering boxes from one door to another so the next appointment stayed ours.\"

"You keep a home and raise a boy through honest shifts," Hale offered, tone level. "We log that truth here."

"I moved three boxes that carried no numbers on the card face and one bundle wrapped in cloth like a gift," Linda continued, eyes on the water and then on the form. "I kept my gaze on the floor because faces linger in the mind. I can draw four scuff patterns along the laundry corridor. Names stay out of my reach."

"We build cases from rooms and routes more often than from names," Dax replied, voice warm and even. "We need carts, pause points, schedules, and the places where a small handoff feels easy. You live that map every day."

"He keeps his senses sharp," Linda continued, words gathering rhythm. "He favors a woman for the quiet passes. She wears boots a half size large and walks heel-toe to cover a limp. She ties release knots with a finger hook so a bundle drops clean when a call moves through the hall. A short scar sits under her left ear and fades when she smiles."

"We can work with a limp, a release knot, and a cap," Hale returned. "We can move a camera to watch for that finger hook."

"When I walk out, I carry a reason for this time," Linda pressed, both hands flat on the table so the tremor could ground itself in wood. "I can\'t just carry a piece of paper that says I took training, I need to actually take the training so I can hold that image firm when questioned. And there is no doubt he\'ll have me in front of him reading me like a book within an hour of my walking out of here"

"Ok we\'ll ensure you get the class," Draeven replied. "Payroll will post the bonus credit, and your schedule shows a care block. A clerk in any office can read those lines and nod."

Her eyes wet from tears till now finally began to dry. She covered her mouth with her palm for one breath, then lowered her hand and kept going because a life moves through hard rooms and still returns home. "I can mark rooms where carts pause clean," she offered. "I can point to vents that turn clear voices into a wash. I can list doors that crews prop during count. I can deliver some of the patterns."

"Patterns are the spine of this ship," Hale affirmed. "Patterns give us a route." She turned a blank diagram and slid it closer. "Start with the first extra half. Draw the path you took with a cart, then mark the place where your breath changed."

Linda lifted the pen and drew with quick, practiced lines: receiving dock, the pivot by laundry, the hinge that holds for a cart, the short cut over the service landing, and the final hallway where a dryer bank throws heat across a blind corner. She tapped the corner where two vents meet. "This sound masks a pass," she explained. "Two vents and a left wheel that squeaks once per turn because the oil stays thin by choice."

"Front left," Dax clarified, keeping the flow steady.

"Front left," she confirmed. "The track runs wide on that side, and the pusher favors the right hand."

"What hour fits this rhythm most days," Draeven asked.

"Between shift change and first break," she answered. "People talk there, floor leads run counts, and carts stand easy."

Halden's voice came through with a clean, present tone. "Hour and vent noted," she reported. "Cameras along that run pick up the squeak even off-axis. I can track it across days."

Linda adjusted her grip, eased the cramp from her fingers, and drew three small crosses along the corridor line. "These turns carry shade from the dryer banks," she added. "A hand can stage a bundle here, then finish the walk unhurried."

Hale wrote a short list: hinge, vent pair, left squeak, right-hand push, three shade turns. "This gives us a sweep plan," she outlined. "We place a camera at the finger-hook height, move one to watch the hinge, and time the carts by squeak across a week."

Linda met Draeven's eyes. "I want a safe walk back to my deck," she requested. "I want a home tonight."

Draeven gave her an assured look of confidence. "Your path crosses a camera with a clear frame, and the log records a worker who finished training, filed a schedule change for care hours, and headed home in a straight line."

Her face softened, and a thin laugh escaped like air from a long-held breath. She wiped one eye with her sleeve edge and kept her chin level. "Thank you," she offered, voice low and steady. "I will bring more corners as I see them."

"We will use them," Hale promised, with a weight that fit the room. "We set the next pass at a price the network won't pay."

Draeven signed the schedule note in clean letters, printed the certificate, and slid both across. "This is your cover," he confirmed. "You earned the credit by surviving the dullest hour on the ship."

Hale rose first so Linda would not rise alone, and Dax opened the door with a neutral face that matched paperwork rather than drama. Draeven walked her to the training hall, matched his pace to hers, and let the corridor read a simple close to a simple hour. In her bag, the certificate lay against the form; on the system, the credit waited for payroll; in her chest, breath found a steady count that would carry her past any listening ear.

Behind them, the Wardens arranged the hinge, the vent pair, the left squeak, and the three shade turns into a sweep that felt like work more than luck. A map began to show itself: source rooms, pause points, and a time window that did not favor ghosts, only patterns a careful team could follow.
