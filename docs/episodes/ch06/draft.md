Chapter 06 - Dissection

"Early morning in the cold room beyond P D three, where the lights hold steady and the air smells of antiseptic."

Mira stood in a sealed hood with her sleeves taped and her hair tucked tight. The glass hummed a low, patient note. Inside the enclosure the juvenile Sunfan lay in a padded cradle, straps snug across plate and limb. Cooling pads breathed under the body in slow pulses. The tranquilizer line glowed a steady green.

"Recording on," she said. "Specimen Sunfan, juvenile. Designation H P L X curvata. Intake twenty two minutes ago. Temperature is falling toward target. Respiration is eight per minute. Tone generator is at whisper, off."

She lifted the lid on the instrument tray. Fine blade, microforceps, suction wand, two resin syringes warming in a stand, labeled vials in a neat array. Each cap wore a color band. Each label carried a time and a place for a number.

"Inspection," she said for the record. "Plate array, count fifteen. Hinge lines clear. Surface shows heat bloom at the edges. Underlayer intact. No signs of struggle or stress fracture."

She set the pads of two fingers on the near hinge and felt a thin, living thrum under the armor, a beat that did not match a human pulse. It reminded her of machines only because it was regular. The plate lifted one grain of height against the strap, nothing more.

"Sedation depth is adequate," she said. "Proceed to tissue windows."

A tech behind the second door read the checklist. "Analgesic field is active. Local is ready. Suction is primed."

Mira drew the first grid line with a sterile marker, a small square just inside the rim of a plate. She flooded the area with local and waited for the skin to pale. The fine blade slid and parted the membrane cleanly. No spurt, only a slow rise of amber fluid with a scent that sat between iron and hot stone. She eased the suction wand into place. The sound in the room shifted by a hair when the line found draw.

"Window one is open," she said. "Membrane thickness, one point five millimeters. Underlayer shows anchor nodes at regular intervals."

She drew the edge back with forceps and saw the nodes, small pale dots along a faint seam. Between them, fine filaments braided and unbraided at rest, the way sea grass moves in a slow current. She felt her shoulders tense, then lift, then settle.

"Anchor sampling," she said. "Two filaments, one node, surface smear."

Forceps in. Snip. A filament lifted, pale and glossy. It turned on the metal and curled toward its own end as if it preferred company. She set it into the first vial and the curl pressed against the glass. The second filament joined it. The pair braided themselves at the bottom of the tube with no hand to guide them.

"Mark sample one A A, filament pair," she said. "One B, anchor node. One C, surface smear."

She touched a glass slide to the wet surface at the seam, drew it away with a line of sheen, and slid it into a warming slot. A faint track remained on the exposed tissue that vanished as the fluid equalized, as if the body did not care to be seen.

"Proceed to hinge," she said.

She traced the hinge line with the blunt end of a probe. The chitin at the joint felt pliant under the touch, warm still, with a layered give that promised strength when it wanted it. She pressed the plate edge up with a lever arm and exposed the hinge fold. The fold carried tiny, dark dots along a deeper crease, a second set of nodes that sat closer than the first.

"Hinge nodes present," she said. "Spacing is tighter. Possible control layer. Take two."

She snipped one, then a second. Each dot leaked a single bead of darker fluid. The beads gathered and sank in place as if weight lived there. She dabbed the edges with gauze and watched the darkness fade.

"Mark sample two A and two B, hinge nodes," she said. "Proceed to vascular cast at window one."

She lifted a resin syringe from its stand, cleared a tiny bubble, and set the tip into the opened seam. The resin moved like a thick thread, pale at first, then clear as it warmed to the body. Under glass, a branching net accepted the fill and lit from within, vessel by vessel, the way frost lights a window in reverse. The lines snaked toward the plate edge, split, and joined again without crossing.

"Cast is moving," she said. "Flow favors the outer lanes. Record time."

The recorder clicked. The world narrowed to the line of resin and the map it drew. She felt the hum through the bench and realized the tone generator had lifted itself by a hair, a bare whisper to the skin. She had not called for it. The tech had not sent it. The control loop inside the machine had read a number and reached for a rule.

"Tone at whisper," she said. "Leave it."

The plate above her hand brightened along the hinge. Filaments in the window drew together by a fraction. The resin ran smoother, like a river when a gate opens.

"Coupling response at whisper," she said, and her voice had lost a measure of air.

She capped the syringe, set it back, and moved to the second window. Another line, another local bath, another clean cut. The smell settled into the room, mineral and faintly sweet, clinical and unsettling because it told the truth about life far from home.

She set a second slide and saw a small shape in the smear, an oval with fine ribs, built to flex. Under the lens, the oval flexed twice, slow, as if testing a new room.

"Microscopy reads live flexion on smear," she said. "Mark slide as three. Set aside for freeze in thirty."

She slid the smear under the camera for a still, then returned to the body. The tranquilizer line glowed green. The pads breathed. Respiration stayed even. The eyes, if eyes lived under plates, did not show. The nearest plate lifted one grain of height and settled again, a movement so small she would have missed it without the strap.

"Proceed to plate edge shave," she said.

She took a ceramic file and drew it once along the plate margin inside the window. The rasp gave up a fine powder that clung to the card. She sent a pinch into a tube and snapped the cap.

"Plate powder marked four," she said. "Surface protein, five."

A gentle tap on the comm. "Lattice here," Elias said from the next room, voice low. "Are you deep in a sequence."

"Yes," she said. "I am in it."

"Then I will wait," he said, and the line clicked off.

"Minutes later, after the first samples were filed and the lids were tight."

Mira shifted her grip to close the second tissue window. The room held its clean, cold breath. The juvenile Sunfan lay quiet in the cradle, straps snug, pads breathing.

"Tone at whisper," she said. "Leave it."

She drew the suture toward the knot. The plate above her fingers lifted a grain and held. The hinge line warmed from dull to bright in a slow band.

"Noted," she said, and reached for the next knot.

The plate rose higher without warning. A ridge edge cleared the strap and came up under her glove cowl. The movement was small, fast, and precise, like a blade that knew what it was for. Mira felt a pressure, then a sting, then heat along her forearm.

Her suit chirped. "Seal breach. Left forearm."

"Tone to zero," she said.

The generator obeyed, but the body answered late. The plates flared. The straps groaned. One buckle screamed metal on metal and let go. The cradle shifted. Tubing snapped and whipped. Amber fluid beaded and ran. The tranquilizer line shivered hard enough to wake a second alarm.

"Back away," the tech said through the second door. "Back away now."

Mira pulled her hands out of the glove ports and sealed the cuffs with a twist. A thin red line seeped under the torn cowl and walked toward her wrist. The sting sharpened to a throb.

Inside the box, the Sunfan flailed. Plate edges struck the glass with a dry, ringing knock that climbed in pitch. The vent at the thorax gaped and shut in fast pulses. The padded cradle slid an inch. The cracked strap fluttered like a cut belt.

"Containment at risk," the tech said. "We do not have time."

"Agreed," Mira said. She reached for the red paddle by the door.

"Confirm," the tech said, voice tight. "Neutralization Protocol Red?"

"Confirm," Mira said. "Breach in progress. My suit is cut."

Her palm hit the paddle. A bar released with a hard click. Four nozzles in the enclosure roof opened their mouths and spoke at once. A white fog roared down like winter from a hatch. Frost raced across plate and strap and glass. The air inside the box went opaque, then cleared in ripples. The body jerked once, twice. Plates rang like ceramic under sudden cold. A hairline crack ran across the largest plate with a sound like ice breaking on a pond. The vent spasmed open and shut, open and shut, then stopped.

"Quench complete," the wall voice said. "Phase two. Hold position."

A second bank fired. Clear jets cut the fog into pale sheets. The sheets crashed into one another and fell. The body seized in a final hard arc, then sagged into the pad with a weight the room could feel, even through glass. A brittle, high note sounded from deep in the cradle and snapped in the middle like a thin wire that had taken all it could stand.

The alarms stepped down to a steady tone. Frost clung to the straps, to the ports, to the edge of Mira's glove. Steam slid along the inside of the glass, then ran in tired lines to the floor of the enclosure.

"Neutralization complete," the wall voice said. "Remain clear. Gas exchange in twenty seconds."

Mira kept both hands against her chest, elbows in, body still. The cut along her forearm burned, then cooled as the suit's patch resin found it and spread. Her breath came in fours because that was the count she knew.

The fog thinned. The shape in the cradle was no longer a living thing. Plates wore a rime that would not melt soon. A fine crackle drifted from the hinges where cold had pried them apart. No strap moved. No vent opened. The room was loud with systems and yet felt like silence.

"Open the outer door and come to the sink," the tech said through the speaker. "Do it slow. Do not touch your face."

"I hear you," Mira said. She turned, stepped out of the hood, and crossed to the wash with her arms lifted away from her body. The first scrub stung the cut. Pink spiraled into the drain and vanished. The second scrub left only clear water and the lemon salt of the soap.

Behind her, the enclosure cycled through its purge. Fans took the fog away. Lights along the frame stepped from red to amber to green. The recorder kept its calm blink, a little metronome that did not care whether the world had just taken a life.

Mira dried her hands with a towel that felt like rough paper. She stood with her palms flat on the edge of the sink and let her head drop for one count, then two.

"Record the incident," the tech said, softer now. "I will log the codes."

Mira lifted her face and found her voice. "Recording on," she said. "Neutralization Protocol Red, initiated by Doctor Mira Jeylan at time mark nine. Cause: sudden, uncontrolled thrash inside primary enclosure, strap failure, suit breach on left forearm. Tone was at zero when movement escalated. Quench deployed in two phases. Motion ceased. Specimen is deceased. Operator is intact. Laceration is sealed. Proceeding to decontamination."

She stopped. The word deceased felt thin in a room that still smelled of frost and hot metal.

The comm clicked. Elias spoke without raising or lowering his voice. "Mira," he said. "Are you safe."

"I am safe," she said. "The specimen is not."

A quiet filled the line. The quiet held a shape that pressed on an unwelcome truth.

"I am coming to the window," Elias said. "You will not open that door until the full cycle clears."

"I will not," she said.

She shut the water off. The room returned to its steady hum. Under the glass, a brittle flake lifted from a plate edge, turned once in a current she could not feel, and settled against the pad. She watched it come to rest. Then she reached for the spray arm and began to wash the glass where her blood had clouded it, one slow circle at a time.
