Chapter 06 - Dissection

"Early morning in the cold room beyond P D three, where the lights hold steady and the air smells of antiseptic."

Mira stood in a sealed hood with sleeves taped and hair tucked tight. The glass hummed a low, patient note. Inside the enclosure, a juvenile Sunfan lay in a padded cradle, straps snug across plate and limb. Cooling pads breathed beneath the body in slow pulses. The tranquilizer line glowed a steady green.

Mira keyed the recorder. "Recording on. Specimen Sunfan, juvenile. Designation H P L X curvata. Intake twenty-two minutes ago. Temperature is falling toward target. Respiration is eight per minute. Tone generator is at whisper, off."

The instrument tray opened on neat order: fine blade, microforceps, suction wand, two resin syringes warming in a stand, labeled vials in a clean array. Each cap wore a color band. Each label left a place for time and number.

For the log, "Inspection. Plate array, count fifteen. Hinge lines clear. Surface shows heat bloom at the edges. Underlayer intact. No signs of struggle or stress fracture."

Gloved fingertips settled on the near hinge. A thin, living thrum worked under the armor, a beat unlike a human pulse. Regular, almost machine-like. The plate lifted one grain of height against the strap, nothing more.

Depth checked, "Sedation is adequate. Proceed to tissue windows."

From the second door, the tech read the checklist. "Analgesic field is active. Local is ready. Suction is primed."

A sterile marker drew the first grid: a small square just inside the rim of a plate. Local flooded the skin until it paled. The fine blade parted the membrane cleanly. No spurt, only a slow rise of amber fluid with a scent between iron and hot stone. The suction wand found draw, and the room's sound shifted by a hair.

The recorder caught her words. "Window one is open. Membrane thickness, one point five millimeters. Underlayer shows anchor nodes at regular intervals."

Forceps drew back the edge. Nodes appeared along a faint seam, small pale dots at even spacing. Between them, fine filaments braided and unbraided at rest, like sea grass in a slow current. Shoulders tensed, lifted, settled.

"For anchor sampling. Two filaments, one node, surface smear."

Forceps closed. Snip. A filament lifted, pale and glossy, curled toward its own end as if it preferred company. Into the first vial it went, pressing against glass. The second filament joined it, and the pair braided themselves at the bottom of the tube with no hand to guide them.

"Mark sample one A A, filament pair. One B, anchor node. One C, surface smear."

A glass slide touched the wet seam and came away with a fine sheen. In the window, the faint track vanished as fluid equalized, as if the body did not care to be seen.

"Proceed to hinge."

The blunt probe traced the joint. Chitin felt pliant under touch, warm still, with layered give that promised strength when it wanted it. A lever arm eased the plate edge up and exposed the hinge fold. Tiny dark dots sat along a deeper crease, a second set of nodes tighter than the first.

"Hinge nodes present. Spacing is tighter. Possible control layer. Take two."

One snip, then a second. Each dot bled a single darker bead. Beads gathered and sank, as if weight lived there. Gauze dabbed the edges until the darkness faded.

"Mark sample two A and two B, hinge nodes. Proceed to vascular cast at window one."

A resin syringe came off its stand. A tiny bubble cleared. The tip entered the opened seam. Resin moved like a thick thread, pale at first, then clear as it warmed to the body. Under glass, a branching net accepted the fill and lit from within, vessel by vessel, the way frost lights a window in reverse. Lines snaked toward the plate edge, split, and joined again without crossing.

"The cast is moving. Flow favors the outer lanes. Record time."

The recorder clicked. Focus closed around the resin line and the map it drew. A faint hum rose through the bench: the tone generator had lifted itself by a hair, a whisper to the skin. No call had gone out. No command from the tech. The control loop had read a number and reached for a rule.

"Tone at whisper. Leave it."

Along the hinge, brightness increased. Filaments in the window drew together by a fraction. Resin ran smoother, like a river when a gate opens.

"Coupling response at whisper."

The syringe capped and returned to its stand. A second window, a second local bath, another clean cut. The room's smell settled to mineral and faintly sweet, clinical and unsettling because it told the truth about life far from home.

A fresh slide lifted a small shape from the smear: an oval with fine ribs, built to flex. Under the lens, the oval flexed twice, slow, as if testing a new room.

"Microscopy shows live flexion on smear. Mark slide as three. Set aside for freeze in thirty."

A still image went to the file, then work returned to the cradle. Tranquilizer line green. Pads breathing. Respiration even. If eyes lived under plates, they did not show. The nearest plate lifted one grain of height and settled again, a motion so small the strap made the difference.

"Proceed to plate edge shave."

A ceramic file drew one clean pass along the plate margin inside the window. The rasp gave up a fine powder that clung to the card. A careful pinch went into a tube and the cap snapped shut.

For the log, "Plate powder marked four. Surface protein, five."

Elias came on the line, voice low, "Lattice here. Are you deep in a sequence?"

Mira kept her focus, "Yes. I am in it."

He kept it simple, "Then I will wait." The line clicked off.

Minutes later, with the first samples filed and the lids tight.

A steady grip closed the second tissue window. The room held its clean, cold breath. The juvenile Sunfan lay quiet in the cradle, straps snug, pads breathing.

Settings confirmed, "Tone at whisper. Leave it."

A suture drew toward the knot. The plate above her fingers lifted a grain and held. The hinge line warmed from dull to bright in a slow band.

For the record, "Noted." Fingers moved to the next knot.

The plate rose higher without warning. A ridge edge cleared the strap and slid up under the glove cowl. Movement was small, fast, and precise, like a blade that knew what it was for. Pressure, then a sting, then heat along her forearm.

Her suit chirped. "Seal breach. Left forearm."

Orders were clear, "Tone to zero."

The generator obeyed. The body answered late. Plates flared. Straps groaned. One buckle screamed metal on metal and let go. The cradle shifted. Tubing snapped and whipped. Amber fluid beaded and ran. The tranquilizer line shivered hard enough to wake a second alarm.

Through the second door, the tech called it, "Back away. Back away now."

Hands came out of the glove ports and cuffs sealed with a twist. Under the torn cowl, a thin red line walked toward the wrist. The sting sharpened to a throb.

Inside the box, the Sunfan flailed. Plate edges struck the glass with a dry, ringing knock that climbed in pitch. The thorax vent gaped and shut in fast pulses. The padded cradle slid an inch. The cracked strap fluttered like a cut belt.

Assessment followed, "Containment at risk. We do not have time."

The red paddle by the door came within reach.

The tech's voice tightened, "Confirm. Neutralization Protocol Red?"

Mira answered, "Confirm. Breach in progress. My suit is cut."

Her palm hit the paddle. A bar released with a hard click. Four nozzles in the enclosure roof opened and spoke at once. White fog roared down like winter from a hatch. Frost raced across plate and strap and glass. Air inside the box went opaque, then cleared in ripples. The body jerked once, twice. Plates rang like ceramic under sudden cold. A hairline crack ran across the largest plate with a sound like ice breaking on a pond. The vent spasmed open and shut, open and shut, then stopped.

The wall voice reported, "Quench complete. Phase two. Hold position."

A second bank fired. Clear jets cut the fog into pale sheets. Sheets collided and fell. The body seized in a final hard arc, then sagged into the pad with a weight the room could feel, even through glass. A brittle, high note sounded from deep in the cradle and snapped in the middle like a thin wire that had taken all it could stand.

Alarms stepped down to a steady tone. Frost clung to straps, to ports, to the edge of the glove. Steam slid along the inside of the glass, then ran in tired lines to the floor of the enclosure.

The wall voice concluded, "Neutralization complete. Remain clear. Gas exchange in twenty seconds."

Both hands stayed against her chest, elbows in, body still. The cut along her forearm burned, then cooled as the suit's patch resin found it and spread. Breath came in fours because that was the count she knew.

Fog thinned. The shape in the cradle was no longer a living thing. Plates wore a rime that would not melt soon. A fine crackle drifted from the hinges where cold had pried them apart. No strap moved. No vent opened. The room was loud with systems and yet felt like silence.

From the speaker, the tech instructed, "Open the outer door and come to the sink. Do it slow. Do not touch your face."

Mira answered, "I hear you." The hood released. The walk to the wash kept arms lifted away from the body. The first scrub stung. Pink spiraled into the drain and vanished. The second scrub left only clear water and the lemon salt of the soap.

Behind her, the enclosure cycled through its purge. Fans pulled the fog away. Frame lights stepped from red to amber to green. The recorder kept its calm blink, a small metronome that did not care whether the world had just taken a life.

A towel like rough paper dried her hands. Palms set on the sink edge. Head dropped for one count, then two.

The tech's tone softened, "Record the incident. I will log the codes."

Mira faced the mic, "Recording on. Neutralization Protocol Red, initiated by Doctor Mira Jeylan at time mark nine. Cause: sudden, uncontrolled thrash inside primary enclosure, strap failure, suit breach on left forearm. Tone was at zero when movement escalated. Quench deployed in two phases. Motion ceased. Specimen is deceased. Operator is intact. Laceration is sealed. Proceeding to decontamination."

The word deceased felt thin in a room that still smelled of frost and hot metal.

The comm clicked. Elias kept his voice steady, "Mira. Are you safe?"

Her reply stayed plain, "I am safe. The specimen is not."

A quiet filled the line. The quiet pressed on an unwelcome truth.

Elias answered, "I am coming to the window. You will not open that door until the full cycle clears."

Her agreement was simple, "I will not."

Water shut off. The room returned to its steady hum. Under the glass, a brittle flake lifted from a plate edge, turned once in a current she could not feel, and settled against the pad. The motion came to rest. The spray arm found her hand, and the glass where blood had clouded it turned clear again, one slow circle at a time.
