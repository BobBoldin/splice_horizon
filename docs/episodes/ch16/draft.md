Chapter Sixteen: Line Hold

The wheel fought them. Cold bit through gloves and turned their fingers slow. Frost lifted off the seam in a thin line and vanished as warmer air slid under the door.

"Hold your lane," Rook told them. "Two more inches."

Metal groaned inside the wall. The lock bar moved a finger's width and stopped. Rook set his feet and pulled again. Tamsin leaned in beside him. The wheel gave another half turn and hit a hard stop.

"Talk to me," Rook called over his shoulder.

"Two shapes at the crawl. One more in the cross hall," Lio reported. "They're waiting for a shoulder."

Rook brought his rifle up. "Two short to the corner. Make them blink."

Lio stepped out, fired twice, and slipped back. Dust leapt from the wall. A curse, then boots scraping.

"Again."

Two more shots. Brass pinged on deck, cooling fast. Silence held. Rook went back to the wheel.

Tamsin checked Geir's side. "Ring tight?"

"It holds." Geir kept his face turned from the lamp. "Just open the damn door."

The wheel moved another notch. The lock bar slid and held. The frame shifted; leverage, not feelings, would open it now.

"Handle."

Tamsin matched his lean. A dull clunk traveled the steel. Rook put a shoulder to the panel and shoved. The door opened the length of his palm.

"Enough. Go."

Lio slipped through and cut right. The inner dock arced long and dim. Painted lines had faded to chalk. A tarp sagged over a busted service skiff. Cold metal, dust, nothing else. She whistled low and waved.

Geir edged through with Tamsin on his harness. Rook backed in last, rifle high. The door sagged back a little and stuck on its own weight.

"Where to now?"

"Far end." Lio pointed. "Service lock. If there's still pressure, it'll cycle."

They ran low along the wall. The deck rippled underfoot like a slow drum from something deep in the station. Lio stripped wire from the lock's cover and popped the clear shield off a manual plunger.

"Break it."

She cracked the shield with a knife butt and pressed. The plunger moved, stopped. Pressed again. A thin hiss woke behind the wall. Locks stuttered, then held a steady hum.

"Waking."

The crawl hatch behind them clanged. A flash of light. Rook shouldered the rifle and snapped two rounds into the doorway. Chips jumped. Someone ducked.

"Stay down," he called. "No one wants to bleed in here."

A reply shot went wide and sparked hard off the far panel. Lio flattened against the hatch. Tamsin held Geir steady with a hip.

The service lock clicked. The handle turned a quarter on its own and stalled. Rook spun it through and pulled. Cold brushed their faces. Inside space for two.

"Pairs. Lio and Geir first. Fast cycle."

They slipped in, sealed, and watched the needle climb. The outer door cracked to dark and spilled fog along the floor. Lio guided Geir into a narrow service bay and keyed the intercom grill.

"Clear."

"Next," Rook told Tamsin.

She moved. A round rang the outer panel like a bell. Rook stayed in the tunnel, covering the corner, and slipped into the lock on the next rise of the needle.

The service bay was a cold box with a grated floor. A dead maintenance sled sat on blocks. A ladder ran to a small ceiling hatch. Air was cleaner here, and there was a steady hiss somewhere close.

"Left," Lio pointed. "Hatch to the outer collar. If the collar is dead, we still get a line of sight."

"Up."

Geir climbed first, careful around the ring. The hatch latch moved. A draft kissed his knuckles. He pushed and found a narrow tube up the station rib.

"Ladder's firm."

Below, fists hammered the lock door. A muffled voice. A metal clunk. They would figure out the cycle. Rook gave them nothing.

"Up. Now."

The tube rang with breath. Frost lined one side like chalk. Old metal felt clean under palms, untouched too long.

At the top, the tube knuckled into a collar with a view slot the size of a hand. Lio wiped it with a sleeve. Dark outside. The planet's edge glowed blue and far. No lanes. No lights. A single strobe blinked, paused, blinked again.

"Signal. Could be ours."

Rook keyed the low band. "Rook on collar. Two out, two in the tube. One walking wounded. We can hold five minutes."

A quiet voice in his ear: "Copy. Two minutes. Hold low."

Rook glanced at Geir. "How do you stand."

"Upright. Keep lights off me."

Tamsin shook her bottle and heard air. "Dry. Water on contact."

Through the slot, the strobe grew to a skiff running dark. A small light flicked twice and went out.

"Two minutes," Rook told them. "We hold here."

Below, the lock banged and gave. Boots hit grating. Rook set a number in his head he could live with.

"If they make the door, we walk the tube and make them crawl. Move as soon as you hear it open. No bunching."

"Understood."

The skiff slid in low. A side panel opened and a hook deployed on a short arm, hovering a hand from the collar rim.

"Line."

Tamsin fed up a loop of webbing. Lio hitched it clean. The line went tight. Thrusters pulsed, holding them steady.

"Geir first. Face down."

He clipped in. Lio and Tamsin eased him across the gap into the open panel. He rolled in and lay flat. A thumb lifted behind the tiny window. The hook dropped back.

"Next."

Tamsin crossed. Lio followed on the second pass. A thud below. The service lock door crashed. Boots in the bay.

"Go," Rook told Lio.

She pushed off. The line took, swayed, and set her in the skiff. Rook clipped, stepped to the rim, and looked back. A shadow moved in the bay. A round snapped past and smacked the tube. No pause. He crossed.

The panel sealed. Plastic and ozone filled the cabin. The pilot's fingers danced. Tiny thrusters shoved, then shoved again. The collar slid away.

"Check in."

"Here," Geir from under his forearm.

"Here," Tamsin, fingers on the ring.

"Here," Lio, eyes on the floor while focus unwound.

A soft light rose. Geir flinched under his arm.

"Lights down," Rook told the pilot.

The glow dimmed. "Three minutes to handoff," she answered without turning.

Rook let the wall take his back. Knuckles felt stiff. He flexed them; the stiffness stayed. No note made. Not yet.

"Hold. We're almost home."

Forty minutes later they were inside, gear stacked against the wall.

The room was small. Metal table. Wall unit that worked when it felt like it. No recorder. Colonel Rane took the far chair. A logistics officer stood by the door with a clipboard.

Rook set the kit case on the table. Hands flat.

"Walk it."

"Cold station. Rival crew present. Trip line on the crate. Blast and partial depress. Geir took a deep lateral tear. We used the array from the crate as a hold. Pads, slurry, ring. Bleed slowed. We moved him through hot and cold zones. Exfil by service collar to skiff. No friendly losses."

"Array performance."

Tamsin unfolded one sheet. "Effective as a rapid hold on soft tissue. Stable under movement once we laced the edge. Not a fix. It bought time."

"Costs."

"Onset low-light gain within minutes. Geir could work in dim better than the rest of us. Cost was light sensitivity. Bright panels hurt. Glare pushed him toward anger. After exfil, standard rations flagged a second issue. Meat made him gag. Plant bars were fine. Water need was high."

Rane looked at Geir's dark glasses. "Manageable."

"In dim, I was fine," Geir said. "In bright, I wanted to smash the light. I kept it under control."

Rane nodded once. "Lenses and route planning cover that. Food is a supply note."

He flicked his eyes at the others. "Any changes on you."

Rook shook his head. "None. I did not take a pass."

Lio: "None."

Tamsin closed her sheet. "One application total. On Geir. That is our full use."

Rane tapped the case. "Good. You used it when you had to. That is the rule. Life on the line."

The logistics officer slid a form across the table. "Incident summary. Sign. Clinic annex will attach labs."

They signed in turn. Rane stood.

"Payment posts tonight. Kit stays here. You will hear from us when the next crate needs hands. Until then, keep the glasses on in bright spaces and flag rations to plant for him. Do not discuss the station."

He reached the door, paused. "Add this line. Field splice used in live conditions. Outcome positive. Side effects noted: photophobia and meat aversion."

The door shut. The wall unit hummed and went quiet.

Tamsin handed Geir a plant bar. "Clinic in an hour."

"As long as they keep the lights down."

Rook latched the case and pushed it to the far side. "We are done."

They stepped into the hall. It smelled like dust and coffee. A clerk passed them water without meeting their eyes. Lio leaned back to let her pulse settle. Geir kept the glasses on and took a slow drink. The job was over. The cost would take longer to count.
