Chapter 09 -- First Steps

Morning in the Wayfarer cradle, where the bay lights are low and the floor hum tells you the ship is awake.

Rourke Draeven stood by the ramp with the quiet stillness that settles people. The Wayfarer's belly was open to the bay. Two Kestrel skiffs sat folded and lashed along the port wall, their frames fitted with surface kits: wider runners, dust shrouds, and a small cargo cradle for sample traps. Everything smelled like clean oil and dry metal inside the ship.

Dax Morlin finished a last check on the door pouch and shut the lid with one firm hand. "Standard carry," he said. "Holstered pistols on safe. Rifles stay racked unless told. Two stun grenades in the door. Masks on for the first hour. Mira calls any changes."

Mira Jeylan stood with the air kit, neat and focused. "Atmosphere reads non toxic," she said. "Nitrogen is high and oxygen is thin. Keep breathers on until I clear the local mix. I have finger clips for pulse and blood oxygen if anyone feels lightheaded."

Nyra Solwyn adjusted the neck seal on her suit. "Copy," she said. "We will start wide, then work the edges."

Renn Afolu checked the straps on his core sampler. "I have beacons and marks," he said. "I will lay a circle around the drop zone and tag soil and stone."

Dax Rovell touched the ramp controls with the care of a person who knew that doors tell stories. "Latches clear," he said. "Ramp ready."

Commander Aric Veynar came on the ship channel with a voice that eased the room into a single rhythm. "Meridian to Wayfarer Twelve," he said. "Final scan is complete. Air is steady. No toxins. Surface wind light and variable. Visual shows an open pan between four regions. Grassland to the east, wet ground to the south, dark stone fields to the west, and a low dune arc to the north. Keep the hour simple. Passive collection only."

Elias Tharros keyed his medical channel. His tone carried steadiness more than comfort. "I am on your channel and listening in," he said. "If a situation needs a mark for later study, I will say so. Otherwise, collect what makes sense."

"Understood," Draeven said. He turned to the team. "Helmets down. Straps on. We go."

The Wayfarer's lift was a slow push that set the stomach back by a small degree. The bay slid away. The ramp drew closed. A soft series of clicks followed like a line of punctuation. Then the hush of drop mode came in, and the air felt close and ready.

"Doors in three," Rovell said. "Two. One."

The ship eased, nose dipped, and the belly light went to amber. The view through the small forward pane showed a world that looked quiet and very awake at the same time. The sky was a pale silver blue. The ground had the sober shine of stone that had seen wind for a long time. Thin haze lay along the horizon.

Evan Trusell's voice was crisp from the Clerk's station upship. "Surface link open," he said. "Mission clock begins on contact."

"Copy," Draeven said. "Set down."

The Wayfarer took the last few meters as if it had always known this place. The skids touched. The ship settled. The ramp light turned green.

"Open," Rovell said, and the ramp lowered with a breath of cooler air. No odor reached them through the masks. Their suit samplers, not their noses, reported trace organics and low humidity.

First steps on Orivay.

They walked down into sound. There was wind, a soft kind that crossed the flat in steady runs. Far off, short calls rose and fell at even intervals. The open pan underfoot was a skin of fused dark stone the size of a landing field. It was warm through the soles. To the east, an amber sheet of thigh-high grass rolled and settled. To the south, the ground darkened and took a sheen. Stands of reed showed pale seed heads. To the west, the ground broke into plates and channels with blue-green crust along the edges. To the north, low iron sand dunes curved in a slow arc.

Mira watched the meters on her wrist and breathed with care. "Breather mix is good," she said. "If anyone feels a float in the head, raise a hand and clip in for a check. I will call a short bare-face test after a few minutes if the ground keeps its promise."

Renn knelt and set a beacon that pulsed a soft white. "Marker one," he said. He walked a measured line and set a second. "Marker two. Circle in progress."

Nyra moved to the boundary where the stone skin met the first reach of grass. She crouched and rested her palm near a thin runnel of dust. "We have a trail," she said. "Single line, light press, three toes and a small claw. It crosses the pan from north to south. The pattern shows a pause here. It looked, then moved again."

Draeven stood behind her with his hands easy at his sides. "Copy," he said. "We will not chase. Mark and lift a print."

"On it," Nyra said. She set a small ring and a gel sheet that would carry the shape home without breaking it.

A flick of motion touched the grass edge. Nyra did not stand. She let the sight come to her. A small animal, long as a forearm, skittered and stopped. Its back held clear plates that bent the glare and blurred the outline, then let it sharpen again. It tasted the air and made a thin chirp.

"Looks like a glassback grazer," Nyra said, steady. "Plates for heat and glare. Feet for crust and soft ground both. It browses, then dashes. If it lifts its plates, the undersides will give us a spectrum we have not mapped."

Renn moved one step to the side and set his core sampler on a crack in the pan. "Taking a core," he said. The tool made a soft push and hum and came up with a clean dark plug of stone and fine grit with threads of blue-green crust.

Mira stepped to the edge of the ramp and watched the numbers steady. "All right," she said after a moment. "We can try a short bare-face test. One person only. Thirty seconds. Then mask back on. Halden, will you do it."

Rhea Halden nodded, unlatched her breather, and lifted it away a finger's width at a time. She drew one careful breath and let it out slow. "Air is dry," she said. "I can taste warm stone and a faint metal note. It sits on the tongue more than it goes deep. I feel a small lightness at the edge of my eyes."

"Masks back," Mira said gently. "Thank you."

A call like a reed whistle came from the south where the wet ground began. A bird rose with long, steady wingbeats and swept along the edge of the reeds, then turned and dipped. It had a narrow head and a thin bright throat. When it banked, bands of light showed along the wing.

"Reedlark," Nyra said. "Wing bands for signal. It patrols the edge between wet and dry. We can collect a fallen feather if we find one."

Draeven set the next step. "We keep to the circle," he said. "Then one slow walk to the grass edge and back. If the ground keeps its manners, we bring the first Kestrel down the ramp and lay a short path to the north dunes and back."

Rovell eased one of the skiffs from its lash and locked the runners with a click that was easy to hear. "Skiff one ready," he said. The frame sat low and wider than the ring version, with a quiet nose and a rack for sample bins. No weapon mounts. Only a beacon pole and a strap bin.

Veynar came back on the channel. "Meridian has your markers," he said. "Thermals are gentle. No large animals within a long stone's throw. Your hour is clean so far."

Amaris Colvern did not speak. If she was listening on a sponsor board, she kept her words for later.

Nyra lifted her chin toward the west. "Look there," she said. On the dark stone field, something large had moved in the last day. A low smear ran along a plate edge. Deep dimples came and went as the light shifted. The track looked like a heavy rope had pressed and lifted and pressed again.

Renn placed a marker at the start of the trail. "Whatever made this was heavy," he said. "It doesn't look like hoofprints or paw marks. Something drags part of itself, then lifts it---a tail, maybe, working like a third limb."

Mira's meter chirped and flashed a soft green. "Breather mix can come down a click," she said. "Do not remove the mask yet though. I want more time across the edges before we spend breath on tests."

Rovell looked north to the iron sand. The dunes held shape and slow slip. "We will have ground shift there," he said. "Runners will want a long arc. I will keep the skiff to the pan edge and test the first length before I put a person on the nose."

"Good," Draeven said. "You will take Halden. Nyra and Renn stay on foot along the grass line. Mira stays with the ramp and the samples. Morlin minds the rack."

Morlin nodded once. "Copy," he said. His reply was steady.

Elias's voice eased in again. "Nyra, if you see seed casings along the grass edge, pick three that show different weathering. Renn, if you find a place where stone meets lichen with a clean line, give me a thin scrape at the boundary. Mira, spool a standard air series and a passive dust capture on the ramp pole."

"On it," they answered in turn.

The team moved with the calm of people who understood that new ground deserves manners. The sun climbed a little. The light warmed. The glassback grazer's plates flashed and settled. A small cloud drifted across the sun and moved on.

Renn stepped down from the pan onto the first run of grass and listened with his boots before he trusted the surface. The ground held. The grass had a dry sound, like silk against cloth. He knelt and found a seed casing that had split into a five-point star. He lifted it and turned it in the light. It came away clean and left a pale ring on the soil.

Nyra stayed three paces off his right and watched for motion that belonged to more than wind. A long, slim shape let itself be seen for one heartbeat and then vanished where a plate of stone lifted. Nyra did not point. She watched, counted ten, and then spoke low on her channel. "We have a shade coil," she said. "Length of a person, maybe a little more. Moves by pulling plates under the skin in a wave. No threat posture shown. Marking its place and leaving it to its day."

Draeven listened. "Thank you," he said. "That is the right call."

Rovell brought the Kestrel down the ramp with his hands light on the bar. The runners kissed the pan and made a thin sound like glass drawing across ice. Halden climbed onto the forward standing pad and checked her straps. Her chest holster sat closed and quiet. She nodded once. Rovell eased the throttle. The skiff slid and then found its line, and the pole beacon sent a slow pulse that let the Wayfarer see their path.

Mira watched their gait, their color, and the way their bodies rode the new motion. "Breathers look good," she said. "If that changes, I will call it."

From the south, the reedlark called again. From the north, a small dust devil stood and fell. The place spoke without raising its voice.

Veynar spoke once more, quiet and steady. "Wayfarer Twelve, Meridian still reads you clean," he said. "You have time for one slow loop and a return. Make your circle, lift what you can, and come home."

"Understood," Draeven said. "We will keep the hour honest."

The team moved in their set lines, small figures on a wide, patient sheet of stone. The skiff traced a careful arc toward the first dune and came back. Nyra peeled a thin skin of lichen from a boundary and tucked it into a dark vial. Renn slid a second core from a spot where the stone had blistered and cooled. Mira's dust sampler clicked and spun a gauze drum that would hold whatever the air chose to give.

At the edge of the wet ground, a set of prints showed in soft mud and then vanished under a sheet of pooled water. The toes were wide and blunt. The stride was long and even. Nyra took a single photograph and left the place as it was.

"Time," Draeven said, reading the sun and the sound of his own breath. "Bring it in."

Rovell guided the Kestrel into its cradle and locked the bar. Morlin checked the door pouch by touch. Mira slid the last vial into a case that sealed with a soft click.

A reedlark's call broke pattern to the south. The ground by the west plates gave a small tremor, steady and regular, as if a slow drum had begun under the stone.

"Eyes up," Draeven said. "Form on the ramp."

From the plate field, a shape rose that filled the space between two waist-high slabs. It moved on thick hind limbs, braced by a heavy tail that struck and planted like a third leg. Broad plates ran along the back and hips. The head was blunt, with ridged brows and small watchful eyes. Each step pressed dimples into the crust and left a smear where the tail drove.

Nyra spoke low, steady. "Hammer tail," she said. "Territorial. Drawn by motion and sound."

"Rovell, block," Draeven said. "Halden on the nose. Slow arc across its sight line. Morlin, stun ready. We hold the ramp."

Rovell dropped the Kestrel to the pan and set it broadside between the beast and the ship. Halden stood forward in her straps and lifted the pole beacon to shoulder height. The strobe pulsed at a slow, even count. She kept the bar level and let the skiff slide two body lengths to the left.

The hammer tail turned toward the movement. It pushed with the tail and drove forward in three hard bounds. Stone dust jumped at each strike. It swung the tail low. The plate at the tip clipped the skiff's runner with a noise like a hammer on a rail.

"Runner holds," Rovell said, jaw tight. "Taking more arc."

"Hold that line," Draeven said. "Do not climb speed."

Mira watched the colors in the faces she could see. "Breathers steady," she said. "Halden, keep your stance. If you feel a head float, call it."

The hammer tail tested the skiff again, this time with a shove of its shoulder. The frame bucked. Halden's strap harness went tight. She set her feet and stayed with the motion.

Morlin slid one step to the ramp edge and pulled a single stun from the door. "I have throw," he said. "Flash and pressure only."

"On my count," Draeven said. "Rovell, bring it two lengths left to open the lane. Halden, strobe stays even. Morlin, throw to the midpoint between nose and head. Three... two... one."

Morlin tossed low. The canister rolled once and settled. White light blew wide and flat across the stone with a hard pop that scraped the ear. The hammer tail flinched and rocked back on its tail plate. It shook its head, blinked hard, and tried to find the skiff again.

"Again," Draeven said, calm but faster now.

"Negative," Mira said at once. "Give it a breath. Watch the gait."

The beast's next step was shorter. It blinked more than it ran. It pushed once more at the skiff, found resistance, and backed a half pace with a grunt that sat low in the chest.

"Rovell, drift toward the ramp," Draeven said. "Halden, keep the strobe. Morlin, door."

Morlin was already moving. He took the last two steps backward and hit the ramp control with the side of his hand. "Ramp up," he called.

Rovell slid the skiff backward in a shallow S until the nose kissed the ramp edge. Halden dropped to the deck as the frame rose under her. The hammer tail surged once more and struck the ramp lip with its plate. Metal rang. The edge bent a thumb's width but kept its line.

"Inside," Draeven said. "Now."

They cleared the lip. The ramp came up. The hinge locks bit. The ship shifted its weight as Rovell set the skiff back into the cradle and threw the latches without looking away from the door.

"Lift," Draeven said.

Rovell gave the ship a gentle nose and rise. The Wayfarer slid free of the pan. The hammer tail struck once at empty air and then stood with the tail down, head tilted, watching the ship go.

Veynar's voice came firm and even. "Meridian copies contact," he said. "Adjust ascent to the north. You are clear. Bring the day home."

"Copy," Draeven said. He looked around the bay. "Sound off."

"Whole," Morlin said.

"Whole," Halden said, breathing steady now.

"Whole," Mira said. "Samples secure."

"Whole," Rovell said. "Runner has a mark. It will polish out."

Nyra set her vial case into the rack and only then let out the breath she had been holding. "Whole," she said.

Renn placed the last core in its sleeve and touched the lid as if it were a promise kept. "Whole," he said.

Elias listened for any strain in the voices and heard only the steep fall of adrenaline. "Good work," he said. "Log the strike, note the dent, and hold that sample mix steady. We will go over it together."

The bay lights warmed by a small degree as the Wayfarer climbed. The ship kept its quiet. The team let the quiet settle into them. The day had more to say, but this hour had been earned.
