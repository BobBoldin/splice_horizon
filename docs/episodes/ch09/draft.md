Chapter 09 -- First Steps

"Morning in the Wayfarer cradle, where the bay lights are low and the floor hum tells you the ship is awake."

Rourke Draeven stood by the ramp with the quiet stillness that settles people. The Wayfarer's belly was open to the bay. Along the port wall, two Kestrel skiffs sat folded and lashed, frames fitted with surface kits: wider runners, dust shrouds, and a small cargo cradle for sample traps. Clean oil and dry metal set the room's scent.

Dax Morlin finished the last check on the door pouch and shut the lid with one firm hand. "Standard carry," he said. "Holstered pistols on safe. Rifles stay racked unless told. Two stun grenades in the door. Masks on for the first hour. Mira calls any changes."

Mira Jeylan stood with the air kit, neat and focused. "Atmosphere reads non-toxic," she said. "Nitrogen is high and oxygen is thin. Keep breathers on until I clear the local mix. I have finger clips for pulse and blood oxygen if anyone feels lightheaded."

Neck seal set, Nyra Solwyn said, "Copy. We will start wide, then work the edges."

Renn Afolu checked straps on his core sampler. "I have beacons and marks. I will lay a circle around the drop zone and tag soil and stone."

Ramp controls took Dax Rovell's touch, careful as a person who knows doors tell stories. "Latches clear. Ramp ready."

The ship channel carried Commander Aric Veynar's even cadence. "Meridian to Wayfarer Twelve," he said. "Final scan is complete. Air is steady. No toxins. Surface wind light and variable. Visual shows an open pan between four regions. Grassland to the east, wet ground to the south, dark stone fields to the west, and a low dune arc to the north. Keep the hour simple. Passive collection only."

Medical came in next. Elias Tharros said, "I am on your channel and listening in. If a situation needs a mark for later study, I will say so. Otherwise, collect what makes sense."

"Understood," Draeven said. He faced the team. "Helmets down. Straps on. We go."

The Wayfarer's lift was a slow push that set the stomach back by a small degree. The bay slid away. The ramp drew closed. A series of soft clicks followed like a line of punctuation. Drop mode hushed the cabin, and the air felt close and ready.

"Doors in three," Rovell said. "Two. One."

Nose eased, belly light to amber, the small forward pane offered a first look: pale silver-blue sky, ground with the sober shine of long-winded stone, a thin haze on the horizon.

Crisp from the Clerk's station upship, Evan Trusell said, "Surface link open. Mission clock begins on contact."

"Copy," Draeven said. "Set down."

Contact came like a habit the ship already knew. Skids kissed. Weight settled. Ramp light turned green.

"Open," Rovell said. Cooler air moved across their suits. No odor reached them through masks. Samplers, not noses, reported trace organics and low humidity.

First steps on Orivay.

They walked into sound. Wind ran in steady passes across the flat. Off somewhere, short calls rose and fell at even intervals. Underfoot, the open pan held a skin of fused dark stone the size of a landing field, warm through the soles. To the east, an amber sheet of thigh-high grass rolled and settled. To the south, ground darkened and took a sheen; pale seed heads marked stands of reed. To the west, the surface broke into plates and channels with blue-green crust along the edges. To the north, low iron sand dunes curved in a slow arc.

Meters steady on her wrist, Mira said, "Breather mix is good. If anyone feels a float in the head, raise a hand and clip in for a check. I will call a short bare-face test after a few minutes if the ground keeps its promise."

A soft white pulse marked Renn's first beacon. "Marker one." He walked a measured line and set the second. "Marker two. Circle in progress."

At the boundary where stone met the first reach of grass, Nyra crouched and rested her palm near a thin runnel of dust. "We have a trail. Single line, light press, three toes and a small claw. It crosses the pan from north to south. The pattern shows a pause here. It looked, then moved again."

Draeven stood behind her with hands easy at his sides. "Copy. We will not chase. Mark and lift a print."

"On it." A small ring set the edge. A gel sheet settled to carry the shape home whole.

Motion touched the grass line. Nyra stayed low and let the view come to her. A small animal, long as a forearm, skittered and stopped. Clear plates arched along its back, bending the glare to blur its outline, then letting it sharpen again. A thin chirp tested the air.

"Looks like a glassback grazer," she said, steady. "Plates for heat and glare. Feet for crust and soft ground both. It browses, then dashes. If it lifts its plates, the undersides will give us a spectrum we have not mapped."

Renn shifted to a crack in the pan and set his core sampler. A soft push and hum, and the tool came up with a clean, dark plug of stone and fine grit with threads of blue-green crust. "Taking a core."

At the ramp edge, Mira watched numbers hold. "All right. We can try a short bare-face test. One person only. Thirty seconds. Then mask back on. Halden, will you do it?"

Rhea Halden unlatched her breather and lifted it away a finger's width at a time. One careful breath in, one slow out. "Air is dry. I can taste warm stone and a faint metal note. It sits on the tongue more than it goes deep. I feel a small lightness at the edge of my eyes."

"Masks back," Mira said gently. "Thank you."

From the south where wet ground began, a call like a reed whistle. A bird rose on long, steady wingbeats, swept the reed edge, turned, and dipped. A narrow head, a thin bright throat, and when it banked, bands of light showed along the wing.

"Reedlark," Nyra said. "Wing bands for signal. It patrols the edge between wet and dry. We can collect a fallen feather if we find one."

Draeven set the next step. "We keep to the circle. Then one slow walk to the grass edge and back. If the ground keeps its manners, we bring the first Kestrel down the ramp and lay a short path to the north dunes and back."

Rovell eased a skiff from its lash and locked the runners with a click easy to hear. "Skiff one ready." The frame sat low and wide, nose quiet, rack set for sample bins. No weapon mounts. A beacon pole and a strap bin, nothing more.

Veynar returned on channel. "Meridian has your markers. Thermals are gentle. No large animals within a long stone's throw. Your hour is clean so far."

If Amaris Colvern listened on a sponsor board, she kept her words for later.

Nyra lifted her chin toward the west. "Look there." On the dark stone field, something large had moved in the last day. Along a plate edge, a low smear. In shifting light, deep dimples appeared and faded. The track read like a heavy rope had pressed and lifted and pressed again.

A marker went down at the start of the trail. "Whatever made this was heavy," Renn said. "It does not look like hoofprints or paw marks. Something drags part of itself, then lifts it. A tail, maybe, working like a third limb."

Mira's meter chirped and flashed a soft green. "Breather mix can come down a click. Do not remove the mask yet though. I want more time across the edges before we spend breath on tests."

Rovell studied the iron sand to the north. Dunes held shape and slow slip. "We will have ground shift there. Runners will want a long arc. I will keep the skiff to the pan edge and test the first length before I put a person on the nose."

"Good," Draeven said. "You will take Halden. Nyra and Renn stay on foot along the grass line. Mira stays with the ramp and the samples. Morlin minds the rack."

Morlin's answer stayed even. "Copy."

Elias came back with quiet tasks. "Nyra, if you see seed casings along the grass edge, pick three that show different weathering. Renn, if you find a place where stone meets lichen with a clean line, give me a thin scrape at the boundary. Mira, spool a standard air series and a passive dust capture on the ramp pole."

"On it," they answered in turn.

The team moved with the manners new ground deserves. Sun climbed a little. Light warmed. The glassback grazer's plates flashed and settled. A small cloud crossed the sun and went on.

Boots listened before weight committed. The first run of grass held. Dry blades made a sound like silk against cloth. Renn knelt and found a seed casing split into a five-point star. He lifted it, turned it in the light, and watched a pale ring remain on the soil where it had rested.

Nyra held three paces off Renn's right and watched for motion that belonged to more than wind. A long, slim shape allowed one heartbeat of visibility, then vanished where a stone plate lifted. No pointing. She counted to ten and went to channel. "We have a shade coil," she said. "Length of a person, maybe a little more. It moves by pulling plates under the skin in a wave. No threat posture shown. Marking its place and leaving it to its day."

Draeven listened and gave the answer the moment deserved. "Thank you. That is the right call."

The Kestrel rolled down the ramp under Rovell's light hands. Runners kissed the pan and made a thin note like glass drawn across ice. Halden stepped onto the forward pad and checked her straps. Chest holster sat closed. One nod. Rovell eased throttle. The skiff slid, found its line, and the pole beacon threw a slow pulse to let the Wayfarer see their path.

Meters and skin tone held Mira's attention. "Breathers look good," she said. "If that changes, I will call it."

South carried the reedlark's call. North lifted a brief dust devil. The place spoke without raising its voice.

Veynar's cadence stayed quiet and steady. "Wayfarer Twelve, Meridian still reads you clean. You have time for one slow loop and a return. Make your circle, lift what you can, and come home."

"Understood," Draeven said. "We will keep the hour honest."

Small figures crossed a wide, patient sheet of stone. The skiff traced a careful arc toward the first dune and returned. Nyra peeled a thin skin of lichen at a boundary and tucked it into a dark vial. Renn drew a second core from a blistered plate. On the ramp pole, Mira's dust sampler clicked and spun a gauze drum to keep whatever the air chose to give.

At the edge of wet ground, prints showed in soft mud and vanished under pooled water. Toes were wide and blunt. The stride ran long and even. Nyra took one photograph and left the place as it was.

Time arrived first in the sun and then in Draeven's breath. "Time. Bring it in."

The Kestrel slid into its cradle. Latches caught. Morlin's palm checked the door pouch by touch. A last vial seated in Mira's case and the lid gave a soft click.

South broke pattern. The reedlark called wrong once. West answered with a tremor under the plates, steady and regular, like a slow drum starting in the stone.

"Eyes up," Draeven said. "Form on the ramp."

From the plate field, something rose to fill space between two waist-high slabs. Thick hind limbs carried the mass. A heavy tail struck and planted like a third leg. Broad plates ran along back and hips. The head was blunt, brows ridged, eyes small and watchful. Each step pressed dimples and left a smear where the tail drove.

Nyra kept the tone low. "Hammer tail. Territorial. Drawn by motion and sound."

"Rovell, block," Draeven said. "Halden on the nose. Slow arc across its sight line. Morlin, stun ready. We hold the ramp."

The skiff went broadside between beast and ship. Halden stood forward in her straps and lifted the pole beacon to shoulder height. Strobe stayed at a slow, even count. The frame slid two body lengths left.

The hammer tail turned into the movement. Tail drove. Three hard bounds. Stone dust jumped. The plate at the tip swung low and clipped a runner with a noise like hammer on rail.

"Runner holds," Rovell said through a tight jaw. "Taking more arc."

"Hold that line," Draeven said. "Do not climb speed."

Faces told Mira what numbers confirmed. "Breathers steady. Halden, keep your stance. If you feel a head float, call it."

A shoulder shove came next. The frame bucked. Halden's harness went tight. She set her feet and stayed with the motion.

Morlin shifted one step to the ramp edge and drew a single stun from the door. "I have throw. Flash and pressure only."

Draeven set the timing. "On my count. Rovell, bring it two lengths left to open the lane. Halden, strobe stays even. Morlin, throw to the midpoint between nose and head. Three. Two. One."

The canister went low, rolled once, settled. White light blew wide and flat across the stone with a hard pop that scraped the ear. The hammer tail flinched, rocked back on the tail plate, blinked hard, and tried to find the skiff again.

"Again." Draeven kept it calm, a touch quicker.

"Negative." Mira cut in at once. "Give it a breath. Watch the gait."

Shorter steps followed. More blinking than running. One more push met the skiff and found a wall. The beast backed a half pace with a grunt that sat low in the chest.

"Rovell, drift toward the ramp. Halden, keep the strobe. Morlin, door." The orders came in steady increments.

Morlin was already moving. Two steps backward, a palm to the control. "Ramp up."

The skiff slid in a shallow S until the nose kissed the ramp edge. Halden dropped to deck as the frame rose under her. The hammer tail surged once more and struck the lip with its plate. Metal rang. The edge bent a thumb's width and kept its line.

"Inside. Now."

They cleared the lip. The ramp came up. Hinge locks bit. Weight shifted as Rovell set the skiff into the cradle and threw latches without looking away from the door.

"Lift."

A gentle rise took hold. The Wayfarer slid free of the pan. Below, the hammer tail swung once at empty air, then stood with tail down and head tilted, watching the ship leave.

The bridge came in firm and even. "Meridian copies contact. Adjust ascent to the north. You are clear. Bring the day home."

"Copy." Draeven swept the bay. "Sound off."

"Whole." Morlin checked the case and closed the strap.

"Whole." Halden let her breath even and rolled her shoulders once.

"Whole." Mira glanced at the rack. "Samples secure."

"Whole." Rovell touched the scar on the runner. "It will polish out."

Only after the vial case seated in the rack did Nyra release the breath she had been holding. "Whole."

Renn slid the last core into its sleeve and tapped the lid like a kept promise. "Whole."

Elias listened for strain and heard only the steep fall of adrenaline. "Good work. Log the strike, note the dent, and hold that sample mix steady. We will go over it together."

Bay lights warmed by a small degree as the Wayfarer climbed. Quiet returned and the team let it settle. The day had more to say. This hour had been earned.
