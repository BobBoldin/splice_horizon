Chapter 28 - On the Mend

Joren lay on his side with the collar off and a slow ache running from the base of his skull to his shoulder. The scan results showed he could take it off, but the room still tilted if he moved too fast. He kept still and tried not to replay the hit. Every time he let it in, he heard the sound of himself meeting the wall and felt useless for three heartbeats that had lasted much longer than they should have.

The door opened. He knew her walk before he saw her face. Kaela stepped to the cot and rested a hand on the metal frame, hair pulled back, eyes clear, no mark except the faint line at her hairline where a visor had sat earlier in the day. She looked whole, which let him breathe.

\"Hey.\"

\"Hey.\" He tried a smile to show he was still here. It worked, even with the ache. \"Flying is not for me.\"

\"I am in favor of you staying on the ground,\" as the corner of her mouth lifted. She wanted to make it light so he would not feel small. He caught that and loved her more for it.

He watched her check him without making it a checklist: color, pupils, the way his breath paused at the top before it came down. She was doing her father's work even when she was not in a lab coat, and part of him felt proud of that and part of him wished she did not have to carry so much.

\"You okay?\" he asked.

\"I will be.\" She meant it. He could hear the truth in the way she held her shoulders: too high when she walked in, a little lower now that she had eyes on him. She had slept a little. The headache had backed off. She was still wound tight about her father's workday, and she did not want to put that weight on him, at least not before he could sit up without checking the room.

She slid a small packet from her pocket and set it on the blanket. \"Brought you something.\"

He opened it. A finger-length chemlight and a strip of mark paint. \"Is this your idea of romance.\"

\"Yes,\" she deadpanned, and then let herself smile. \"Tape the light flat on your back strap so I can find you. Mark frames at knee height. Humor me.\"

He wanted to tell her that the two squeezes on his shoulder when he woke had done more than any gear, but he tucked the packet into the pocket by his hip and kept the thought for a second. \"I will. Thank you.\"

Silence settled the right way, not awkward, just space they had learned to share. He watched her fingers on the frame and thought about the tunnel, the kid's wrists under his hands, the plea not to be sent back. He did not want that to turn into a clean line on a report and then fade.

\"My head is better, since I was able to get a few solid hours of sleep.\"

\"Good.\" He took the cup she offered and drank, careful to stop before his stomach argued. Their fingers brushed when he passed it back. He kept his hand close to hers on the frame. Close felt like honesty.

He took a breath and let himself say it. \"The kid I cuffed asked me not to send him back. There is an ugly part festering in the hidden parts of this ship.\"

Her eyes came up to meet his. She had been waiting for him to bring it up, because pushing him there would have felt like forcing a wound open. \"I know.\"

\"I do not want to forget his face when this turns into maps and lists.\" He hated that he sounded young when he said it, but he was young, and he would rather be honest than pretend he had already hardened into whatever people think Wardens are supposed to be.

\"Then don\'t.\" She slid her fingers under his and held. \"Tell me when the image starts to fade, I will be here to remind you. That is part of what this is.\"

He nodded and felt his throat tighten. He wanted to tell her he loved her right then, but he had a superstition about big words in recovery rooms. The last time he had spoken something heavy around hospital light, someone had not come home. He would say it when they were under ordinary light, walking, not lying down.

Instead, he asked, \"How is everything else going with you and the family?\"

\"I am a bit worried about my father. He wants to ease side effects before I need the remedy. He\'s been overexerting himself lately. We\'re testing a small tweak, and I need to be there to keep him from skipping any steps. He listens when I\'m in the room because I hold the checklist, and the techs back me.\"

\"I trust you,\" he smiled, and meant it. \"Be careful anyway.\"

\"I am.\" She leaned in and kissed his forehead, light and sure. She only learned the details after they came back: the hit, the wall, the way he went still. The fear landed then and had not quite let go. \"You\'re going to rest. No hero moves. If the room tilts, you sit.\"

\"Yes, ma'am.\"

\"Don\'t make me find you a new collar.\" They both smiled at the same time because it felt good to act like this would be easy to enforce.

He studied her face. The visor line from her lab shield was already fading. A small sleep mark on her wrist where she must have dozed against the edge of a table before coming here. He wanted to put that wrist against his cheek, which was not a thought he had planned, but that is what being twenty-two and in love does to a plan.

\"I am proud of you.\" She had saved it until now because she wanted it to land without a medic walking in or a monitor beeping over it. \"You kept your feet as long as you could. You made the right choices. You let the team do the rest. That is the work.\"

He felt heat behind his eyes and let it sit without looking away. \"Say it again.\"

\"I am proud of you.\"

He tucked that sentence in the safe part of his head where panic could not reach it. \"I am keeping that.\"

\"Good.\" She lifted his hand and kissed the inside of his wrist, then set it down and watched his breathing settle. She could see when the concussion threatened to steal his balance and when it backed off. \"Nap now. Walk later. I will come back after lab.\"

\"I will be here.\" He wanted to add always, but he liked the small word better today. It felt truer.

She bent and kissed him for real: slow, careful, enough to quiet the leftover shake in his chest. \"I am glad you are still here. I plan to keep being glad tomorrow.\"

\"Me too.\"

She left. He watched the ceiling grid until his eyes slipped closed. The last clear thing he felt was the shape of her hand in his and the clean, simple promise of seeing her again after lab, which was more medicine than anything on the cart.

The Custodian read the message twice before he let himself breathe. The slate rested on a bare table in a stripped tram spur that had served as a work lab for three weeks and would not survive another twelve hours. Rails were pried up. Ties were stacked against the wall as makeshift shelves. Crates lined the far side: blue tags for micro couplers, red tags for battery packs. Solvent hung in the air near the floor drain because someone had cleaned fast after the last intake and missed the grout.

From: Cold Mother. To: Custodian. Rotation 6.

Your branch is exposed. The brute you backed threw himself at soldiers and died. Workers were taken. You will close the work labs on this ring in twelve hours. Move the micro couplers first. Break the kits. Burn the adhesive stamp. Change the battery scoring. Anyone seen goes dark for a month.

Stop building showpieces. No more ox chests. Compliant frames only. The base mesh is for work and recruitment, not theater. You fell behind because you chased a legend you named Anvil. That was sentiment. We do not spend sentiment.

Pull the couriers. Rotate routes. Use the maintenance closets and the tram storages we marked in rotation 3. Keep mothers and younger brothers off the lists for a while. We do not need noise.

When you are done, send me inventory. If you cannot hold a branch without me, say so. I will replace you.

He closed the message and counted the room like a ledger. Two coupler rigs on the main bench. One spares box under it. Three battery crates. Four adhesive rolls with the circle-and-three-lines stamp that would have to die. Eight kit bags already loaded. A stack of folded smocks. A tray of coupler heads soaking in sterilant. A cooler with protein drinks and a half bag of apples because one tech believed in food before any cut.

He raised his voice. \"Front.\"

They came fast. Frank, the older cousin type with a face people trusted and a bag that never emptied. Linda, young enough to pass as a lost intern in a service corridor if no one looked at her hands. Carl, the dockhand with a limp that got worse when he ran. Two techs in gray smocks who knew what a teardown meant and liked it less than they said.

He held up the slate. \"Read it when we are done. You know the shape. We are burned. The brute died. Workers got picked up. We close in twelve. We move the micro couplers first. Frank, you take blue tags to the north maintenance closet, locker three. Use the cart, not your back. No stops. If anyone speaks to you, you are a cleaner and you are late. Keep your eyes down. No clever.\"

Frank nodded and reached for the cart. \"How many runs.\"

\"Two,\" the Custodian confirmed. \"Stack low, stack wide, sheet over the top. If something drops, do not bend. Keep walking. Carl, you shadow to the turn, then peel to the cable vault and sweep the overhead. If you see a live lens, fog it. No sparks. No alarms.\"

Carl's mouth pulled tight. \"Want the line cut.\"

\"I want quiet,\" the Custodian said. \"Fog and tape. If you have to touch a wire, you do it like it is sleeping and you want to leave it that way.\"

He turned to Linda. \"Pull the couriers. Routes rotate now. You run maintenance closets only, then hold at tram storage two and wait. You do not touch main corridors. You recruit no one. If someone waits near our door with a story, you hand them a food pack and walk. You leave them with nothing to follow.\"

Linda stood straighter than her nerves wanted. \"The boys at G-12 think a kit is coming.\"

\"They think wrong today. You give them nothing but quiet. Tell them to sleep. Tell them to hide. Tell them nothing else.\"

He faced the techs. \"Break the kits. Strip intake bags. If it has a serial, file it. Battery scoring changes to zig short, long, short. I will say that once. No notes. You burn the stamp now. Steel pan. I want glue in the drain. When you are done, wash with vinegar and wash again.\"

The steady-eyed tech looked at the adhesive rolls. \"We could slice the stamp off.\"

\"Burn it. If I see that circle tomorrow, I will know it is yours and you will not work in this branch again.\"

She took the pan without another word. The second tech stacked the rolls and the alcohol, set the pan by the drain, and worked a light. The first burn pushed a sour smell into the room. He called for the small fan and let it pull the air along the floor and out into the dark service hall.

He pointed to the rigs. \"Pull heads. Pack bodies. Dry every tray. If anyone walks through here in six hours, it should look like a storage spur no one has touched in a year.\"

Frank pushed the cart toward the hatch. Blue tags looked like a parade if you knew what you were seeing. The Custodian shifted the top crate. \"Low, not high. Put rags and a mop on the top. If anyone stops you, they see a man who drew the short end of the shift.\"

Frank adjusted, covered, and rolled. The wheels squeaked. The Custodian marked the sound for later. He would oil them when the cart came back. Squeaks draw eyes.

Linda did not move. \"What do I say to families if they show near the service hall.\"

\"You are a cleaner. You know nothing. If they put a photo under your nose, you shake your head and point them to station help three sectors away. Do not argue. Do not be kind. Do not promise.\"

He felt heat stack under his ribs at the word families. Cold Mother had written to hold mothers and younger brothers off the lists for a while. Doctrine, and also the line that keeps noise down. He knew it and hated himself for the part of him that understood the logic. He turned that heat into order. He was good at order.

He tapped through a list. Names. Debts. Ages. He struck three younger brothers from next intake. He struck two mothers who had sent messages to the rumor line. He told himself that counted as care. He told himself not to like how it felt.

Carl returned from the cable vault. \"Lens is fogged with tape. If they check today, they will call it dust.\"

\"Good. Take two red tags to tram storage two. Behind the wheel racks. Not high. If anyone steps in, you look for a wrench and you look like you lost it last week.\"

Carl hefted the crates and went. The tech at the pan stirred the stamp until the mark collapsed into black. She poured alcohol and stirred again. The smell sharpened. He did not flinch. He had burned marks before. He would burn this one again in his head each time his fingers reached for a stamp out of habit.

The other tech brought a battery pack. \"Scoring changed. Zig short, long, short. We can teach the runners.\"

\"You teach no one. You show the pattern once to me, to Frank, to Linda. That is the classroom. If a courier cannot remember three cuts, they carry food and keep quiet.\"

Linda did not blink. \"I remember three cuts.\"

\"I know. That is why you are here instead of out in the cold\"

He walked the benches. Coupler heads, soak trays, smocks, apples. He took an apple and bit once because he wanted sugar and because he did not want to be the man who tells people to eat and then forgets it for himself. Mealy. He tossed it in the drain and told himself he would replace the bag when they opened somewhere else.

He found the youngest courier sorting coupler heads by size to look useful. The Custodian crouched to be level. \"Listen. Today is not for bravado. You carry messages. If anyone stops you, you look bored. If anyone asks a question with a real answer, you say you do not understand. You do not go near a door that is not ours. You see a soldier, you turn around and forget why you were there.\"

The kid nodded quick. \"I can do that.\"

\"You can and you will if you know what is good for you. If you see a woman crying, I better not hear you stopped to talk to her. Am I being clear enough for you?\"

The kid looked scared and ashamed at once. \"Yes.\"

He stood and felt his knees protest. He was not young. He had started young. He had promised himself he would not become a man who gave orders from a chair. He still stood. He still lifted. He still checked the floor himself for drops that told stories he did not want told.

He typed a draft to Cold Mother. Inventory to follow. Blue tags moved first. Kits broken. Stamp burned. Scoring changed to zig short, long, short. Couriers pulled. Routes rotated to maintenance closets and tram storages per rotation three. Workers who were not seen are quiet. Mothers and younger brothers held off the lists for four weeks. The Anvil dead. We will not build that frame again.

He did not send it yet. He opened the steel locker beside the bench. Three micro couplers with serial plates ground to haze. One plate showed a corner that had not been finished. He filed it flat, tapped filings into solvent, and stirred until they looked like dirt. He washed his hands with vinegar and waited until the smell eased before he reached for anything else.

Linda came back through the hatch with a small nod. \"First drop is clean. No one is in the corridor at the moment. One door shut that is usually cracked.\"

\"Head to the second drop then and take Carl.\"

\"I can take it alone; I don\'t need a babysitter.\"

\"You can, but you will not. Question my orders again and you won\'t be going anywhere. Alone or otherwise, now go.\"

He called the techs again. \"Base mesh stays. No visible builds for a month. No ox chests. No big arms. If a recruit wants a story, you tell them work pays and flash gets them caught. If a tech argues, send them to me. I will do the arguing.\"

\"Cold Mother will do it for you,\" the steady-eyed tech said, though not very loud.

He heard it anyhow but let it pass. He pushed both coupler rigs into a crate and tied them down. He checked the knot twice. He did not forget knots.

Frank returned with the empty cart and breath that did not sound like he had run. Good. \"North drop was clear. The cleaner act worked just like you said it would. One patrol walked by and asked me if I had a spare rag.\"

\"Take the second,\" the Custodian directed. \"Then bring me the blue tags list and the three names of anyone who knows any part of the move. I want the names in my pocket. I want the name of anyone who even breathes our routes.\"

Frank allowed himself a thin smile and let it go. \"I like your lists.\"

\"I like us alive, now move.\"

The room thinned as tasks went out the hatch. The burned stamp lay in a curled lump of black in the pan. He let himself look at it and feel the clean, simple anger he saved for symbols that make people brave and sloppy. He had liked that mark. It made the kits feel owned. Cold Mother was right. Marks get you seen. He told himself to learn it this time.

He wrote a short order for the field list and read it out to hear the tone. \"We close this branch in twelve hours. Micro couplers out first. Kits broken. Stamp burned. Scoring changed. Routes rotate to maintenance closets and tram storages. If anyone is seen, they disappear for a month. No recruitment. No talk. Compliant frames only. If you cannot follow, step out and your name ends here.\"

He sent it. He sent the inventory next. He did not add more about the Anvil than the line in the draft. He had liked the man before the work ruined him. He had watched him lift a shield for a kid who had asked for a second dose he could not carry. He had also watched him crash through a wall to hit soldiers like it was sport. Cold Mother called that sentiment. He called it a mistake that got workers taken. He would not build that frame again.

Linda and Carl returned with empty hands and open faces that said the second drop had gone as well as they could ask. The benches were bare. Trays dry. Crates by the hatch. Nine hours left. He would be finished by six if no one tried to be smart.

He opened Cold Mother's message one more time and let his eyes sit on the last line. If you cannot hold a branch without me, say so. I will replace you.

He did not argue with a screen. He nodded once, closed the slate, and got back to work.
