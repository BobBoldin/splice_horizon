Chapter 41 --- Short Accounts

The Custodian walked the laundry corridor with a slow, even pace, hands behind his back, eyes on corners the way a butcher eyes edge and grain. Dryers thumped. Steam hung low and warm. The hinge hold ticked once every three beats because the spring liked that rhythm. He breathed through his nose and let the hallway talk.

Citrus cleaner lived on the floor from the morning mop, yet another note cut through it: sharp solvent with a sweet tail that clinics use on carts when they want a room to feel safe. Wardens carry that scent because they like tidy work and bright logs. He tasted copper a second later from a scuffed panel, the kind you lift when you borrow power without permission. He bent at the hinge and felt one cold screw among three warm ones, which told him a glove visited today and a hurried one at that.

He nudged the towel bin with his knee. The front left wheel squeaked once, then hushed, then squeaked again. Someone had oiled it halfway, which meant a crew with brains and a crew with a clock at their backs. He held the bin for one roll and let it go. The squeak came on the fourth rotation like a metronome with a chipped gear. He smiled without humor and let a quiet "hell" roll out of his chest.

The storage alcove sat tidy enough to pass inspection, yet the service box wore a new face with dull tool lines that factory hands never leave. He pressed two fingertips along the plate and picked up a fine grit like sawdust from a thin blade. Fresh metal smells tired and honest. This carried new cut under cheap paint. He turned his head toward the vent pair and listened. Air poured steady, yet the pitch lifted a hair at the merge, as if someone bumped the setting by five percent to hide a short word or two. Wardens like cover that feels like maintenance; he taught three of them that lesson by hand long ago, and the memory kept his jaw tight now.

He crouched and ran a knuckle along the floor where the cart pivots. The scuff line broke twice and kept going, which meant a watcher stood in the turn, shifted, then stood again to catch another angle. He pictured Hale's stance from old footage: weight on the outside foot, elbow tight, camera low. He muttered "bastards" once and stood.

A clerk shoved a cart past with a grunt, saw him, and froze a half step too late. The Custodian did not raise his voice. He held up a finger and the man parked, then backed away fast enough to tell a story about nerves. Good. Fear kept tongues slow.

He leaned into the alcove and looked where most people never bother to look. The shelf pins wore fresh polish on the right side, not the left. The lower lip of the second shelf carried a skin of foam solvent. A knot mark in the strap next to the bin showed a finger hook, then a quick pull that straightened the lay. Linda's loop. His loop. All of it clean, yet the rhythm rang off. He had taught this corridor to sing, and someone sang his tune with new words.

He set a hand on the doorjamb and listened with his ear bone. The hinge chirped a dry bird sound now, different than earlier, which told him some fool hit it with a squirt after the pass to look busy. He could find that fool by scent in an hour. The man would touch every hinge in sight to hide the one that mattered, and that kind of panic leaves trails thick as paint.

Carl met him at the far end with a packet of camera logs and a face that carried effort more than guilt. The Custodian took the packet and skimmed. A maintenance ticket blocked two eyes for six minutes at ten forty-eight. The text read like a copy from the book. The signature ran tight and careful in a hand used to margins. He lifted the page to his nose and scented pencil, cheap hand soap, and a trace of bitter ink some offices buy because it lasts. Halden's wing buys that ink. The Wardens walked his hall under a friendly umbrella. He felt heat rise behind his eyes, then slow and harden into a good tool.

"Follow me," he told Carl, voice flat. "I will teach you what the room hides."

They paced the route end to end. He set Carl's hand on the door plate and guided his fingers to the cold screw. He placed Carl's knuckles on the scuff line and showed where a watcher shifted stance because a knee got sore. He made Carl listen to the vent merge until the pitch change felt like a pebble in a boot. He sniffed the panel edge and named two solvents and one clinic polish. He let the hallway lecture finish in his chest with a small curse.

"The Wardens worked here," he concluded. "They brought a rag, a camera, and a good lie. They timed a squeak and a hinge. They opened my box with a friendly tool and a plan. They walked out calm and clean with two vials and a coupler that men pay fortunes to touch."

Carl kept his mouth shut and his eyes wide. The Custodian respected that. Men who fill a quiet with chatter waste rooms.

He turned from the tour and pulled a thin slate from his inside pocket, the one that rides a line no one on this ship audits. He dialed a number that rings on Earth in a house where money breathes heavy. The voice that answered carried silk and a smile.

"Your parcel misses its hour," the Custodian told him. "Stock up here reads steady; hands down there read loud. You will receive your money this evening. You will receive a new date when my forge broker sings me a clean number."

"Unhappy," the voice replied, soft as cream. "Our friend grows tired."

"Our friend can grow a beard while he waits," the Custodian returned, warmth gone. "A replacement here takes time that lives in physics. He climbs a ladder faster than that and falls off the top. I keep accounts short. He keeps his temper short in his own house."

He cut the call and let the gear turn. Refund buys quiet. Quiet buys time to move parts and clean habits. Murder of a customer buys noise and eyes from men who carry badges with jurisdiction. He would save bullets for the mouths that leaked and the hands that staged.

He approached the exact drop point and crouched again. A hint of citrus mixed with human salt lived in the dust along the baseboard. He touched it with a fingertip and brought it to his tongue. Hale runs on citrus and discipline. He could taste both. He looked along the ceiling and found a camera eye with a hairline smear on the lens that maintenance hands leave when they wipe with a little plastic sleeve. The smear angle matched a lefty balled fist. He stored that detail next to the ink choice and the hinge chirp.

A courier pair came up quiet at his call. Heavy boots. Clean gear. No swagger. He liked them.

"Pull the drain screens from the laundry sinks, both sides," he ordered. "Bag them and log times. Bring me glove liners off every cart crew that touched this corridor between ten and eleven. Then pull garbage bags from the three rooms I mark, and strip the first ten millimeters into separate sacks. That top layer tells me what I need faster than any confession."

"On the move," one answered. They stepped light. He watched their backs and pictured them later, when a softer approach failed. He had men for that, too, men with quiet shoes and long memories.

Linda walked past at that moment with a stack of folded sheets and a jaw that wanted to shake. He clocked her pulse in two heartbeats and tasted soap and straight fear, the kind that comes from being caught in a storm without a coat. He pulled a breath through his nose and sorted her from the pile. She carried courage and a mother's schedule. The Wardens had already dropped a shield over her with a payroll trick and a training slip. He did not kick shields if they offered cover he could use. He logged her route and kept walking.

Frank rolled a bin into a new stall and kept his eyes down because he knew the shape of the man who watched. Sweat tracked one line along his temple again. The Custodian filed it under honest nerves rather than yards of guilt. He would check Frank's bed tonight anyway, and Frank would either sleep like a worker or talk like a fool. Either way, the ship would teach lessons.

He reached the alcove, knelt where the coupler box had sat, and pressed his ear close. The floor told weight in short bursts that matched the cases Dax favors when he wants a camera to feel bored. He whispered "Dax" once because names help focus anger into useful files. He let the anger fill his mouth with heat and held it there until it turned into something he could write with.

Back in his office, he threw the inventory slip on the table and let the slam count as punctuation. Two vials, not a gram between them, yet each worth more than this deck on a good day. A for skin and marrow, clean as old money. B for heat without a leash, perfect for men who confuse hunger with power. Both laced with a drop of violet that turns biology into a quiet road. He leaned on his knuckles and held the room silent long enough for the heat to cool into steel.

"Scrub the ranks," he growled to the two couriers he had kept. "Top to bottom. I want the names of any runners with new shoes, new watches, new lovers, and fresh pride. I want a list of every maintenance ticket that touched those cameras, with faces and rooms and times. I want drink talk, game talk, and men who lean too close when they reach for a light. Put each name on a line and write your gut feeling next to it. Cheerful for straight. Greasy for bent. I read guts before I pull triggers."

They nodded. He stepped toward them and let his voice drop.

"Loose lips lick steel," he told them. "I set the steel and choose the hour. Bring me the names that taste wrong."

They left. He took the slate again and wrote three headings: Broker, Vendor, Wardens. Under Broker he wrote the Earth contact with the silk tongue and a dollar spine. Under Vendor he wrote the clip stamp and the clerk with small neat initials and a finger hook on every knot. Under Wardens he wrote Halden, then a time window, then a smear on a lens, then a hinge chirp. He drew arrows like a foreman laying rebar: simple, straight, strong.

He pulled one more number and got a crew that cleaned problems late and kept their mouths shut about it. The line clicked. A voice like gravel answered.

"I want walks through runner rooms tonight," he ordered. "Sit on their couches. Ask about shoes, watches, and who keeps them warm. Listen for stories that grew in the last week. Friendly tone. Heavy hands when needed. If a mouth runs, it takes air at the waste dock and learns a short lesson about respect."

"Understood," the gravel replied. "We bring a page by midnight."

"Bring two pages," he corrected. "Names on one. Habits on the other. Habits tell more truth than oaths."

He cut the call and walked back to the corridor for one last read. The vent tone held. The hinge chirped twice and then quit after a tech walked past with a red can and tried to erase a fact. He smiled once, a bar of teeth with no warmth in it.

"Wardens want in my house," he muttered, voice low. "They think luck rides with them. Luck rides men who work clean. I work cleaner."

He chose refund for the Earth bastard because refunds move money back and silence forward. He chose pain for mouths near home because pain teaches. He placed both choices in his ledger and snapped the book shut.

The hallway breathed warm around him. He tasted citrus and steel and a thread of clinic polish that belonged to someone who believed in tidy sins. He set his hands behind his back again, turned on his heel, and started the sweep that would pull this deck inside out. The next courier who carried violet would walk under new rules. The next clerk with neat initials would learn how ink mixes with blood on paper. The next Warden who stepped into his air would smell him first and understand what kind of man ran this corner.

He felt the ship keep time under his boots and welcomed the count. Work waited. Names waited. A map waited. He would draw it with steady lines and sharp pencils, and he would hang it where only he could reach.

He paused in the doorway and checked the time. The ledger carried two lines now: refund for the Earth whale and a full scrub at home. That covered money and muscle. One line still waited. Cold Mother liked short accounts and fast math. She wrote in ice and expected receipts on the hour. Thanatium lived on her altar as a sacred inventory line, and lost stock pulled interest with teeth.

He pictured the message that would come: three sentences, a cost figure, and one question that cut past excuses. She valued clean plans over warm promises and preferred a headcount to an apology. He drafted his answer in his head: refund processed, routes altered, cameras trapped, names in motion, and a delivery window for fresh pins from the forge when the broker breathes a date. He would add a list of habits pulled from beds and drains, and a map with arrows that point toward the next seizure.

He set the room for that call: chair square, light high, and a thin folder with pages that speak faster than men. Cold Mother respected order and blood in equal measure, and she read fear through static like a wolf reads heat through brush. He rolled his shoulders once, eased his hands flat on the table, and welcomed the pulse that climbed. A man earns rank by meeting storms upright.

The screen stayed dark, which meant another hour to sharpen the blade. He kept his voice low and even for the empty room. "Message comes soon," he told the air. "I bring numbers, names, and a plan that draws blood and money in the right order." He turned back to the corridor and began another slow pass, ears open for the small sounds that make cases. Cold Mother liked hunters. He planned to answer as one.
