Chapter 51 --- Pumps on the Flats

Shuttle One dropped through thin cloud and leveled over the north flats. Brine spread in pale sheets between dark ridges that held their lines like broken walls. Wind pushed grit into snakes across the crust. Lightning flickered far to the west and kept its distance. Rane watched the approach with one palm braced on the bulkhead and counted their checks under breath.

"Gear stays tight," she reminded. "We unload fast, stage clean, and build the ring."

The skids touched with a short bump that lasted less than a heartbeat. Heat blew through the open ramp. Salt rode the air like powder. Joren felt the planet in his ankles and knees and read the ground as stable enough, with soft pockets near glossy patches. He stepped off with the first hose saddle and turned for the stake bag because order lives in simple sequences.

Hale led the short team to the pump skid and worked the straps with clean pulls. The new gloves warmed around her knuckles as they tracked her grip and met each twist before her wrist finished the thought. She liked gear that helps with timing and stays quiet. The pump rolled free. Draeven and a deckhand levered it down a plank and into the sand screws that Muniz had marked with two quick lines in the dirt.

Shuttle Two came low and dropped the manifold crate and hose reels with a gravity that felt honest. Dax walked the load with one hand for balance and his eyes on the ridges. He placed the tripod gun on its pad behind the tanks and locked the legs with three measured turns. The Kestrel mount gun stayed in its case, stacked under a tarp with feed trays and spare barrels. He respected days that begin with tools covered and end with tools cleaned.

Patel trotted out a line from the pump skid and kept her voice even. "Strainer frame here," she directed. "Buoyant collars on, mesh tied, silver ribbon tagged. We seat it before draw so it rides clean water rather than mud."

Muniz and a deckhand built the frame in three minutes because they liked straight jobs and working hands. They floated it with a push and a short line back to a stake that Joren had already planted. The flat took the frame without a fuss. Small ripples brushed the mesh and moved on toward glare.

Halden laid out medical and water kits in a shade tent with the open side away from the gusts. She set a timer on her slate and handed out salt tabs like a shop floor nurse who knows how men forget thirst when work runs hot. "Drink on the timer," she reminded. "Do not wait for a headache to teach you manners."

Rane walked the perimeter and planted beacons with strobes turned to steady. She placed Point One at the pump head, Point Two at the hose header, Point Three at the manifold, and Point Four on the shuttle line. She watched the beacons blink in sequence and then in pairs, which pleased her because patterns keep nerves steady. She checked the arc on Dax's tripod and adjusted one leg by a thumb's width to keep the muzzle off the shuttle path.

Hale strapped a short shield to her forearm and pulled the gloves tight. She rotated wrists and opened her hands twice. Gel settled under the knuckles like a thin pillow that hardens when needed. She bounced a fist off the training pad once to feel the stiffen, then touched the pump console with two fingers as if the habit could bless the machine. Rituals carry weight when work counts.

Joren set the header saddle at waist height and checked cam locks for grit. He ran a glove along each seal and rubbed a grain of sand to dust. Draeven stood beside him and watched angles with the patience of a man who believes in first-pass quality. They made the header square, then pulled the first run from the pump.

"Pins in at a flat," Joren called, voice clear. "Seals clean and collars straight."

"Good line," Draeven returned. "Keep hose away from that crust. It looks pretty until it swallows a foot."

They ran two lengths to the manifold and hung weight on the arc so wind would not hunt for play. The manifold landed on blocks with gauges facing Dax and vents clear for quick hands. Dax turned each valve through a cycle to feel seat and throw. He marked one handle with tape where it liked to stick, because tape reminds the hand when heat steals memory.

Patel crouched at the pump with Muniz and primed the head with tank water that smelled like a closet where the detergent lives. The pump hummed and settled. The intake line stiffened. Pressure found the header and ran down the hose like a rumor turning into a story. Joren watched the gauge climb to a mark they had chosen for this flow and held it there with a small touch.

"Draw looks honest," Muniz reported, eyes on the strainer. "Grit sits down. Foam stays low. We watch the gusts and keep the mesh clean."

Rane lifted her slate and logged the first minute of flow with a small satisfaction that touched her mouth and left. She raised the ship net. "Meridian, Point One," she announced. "Draw established. Flow reads within targets. Tanks filling. Overwatch holds in clear air."

"Copy, Point One," Colvern returned. "Keep your circle tight. Shipboard stills carry the morning. You carry the afternoon."

Crews fell into a rhythm. Hose thumped on the header and settled. Pins clicked, collars seated, and seals held. Dax watched the ridges through a shade band and let his eyes float from angle to angle the way he used to watch alleys. Hale paced the pump, kept a hand on the emergency kill, and checked the gap under her boots for any shift. Draeven walked the path between header and shuttle line and brushed sand over glare where a foot might slip. Halden moved water down the line and made sure hands drank while they worked.

By midmorning the first tank hit its mark. The gauge rose through clear numbers. Valve two cracked. Valve one eased. A clean stream crossed to the second tank with a sound like a steady rain against a tarp roof. People in the ring breathed in time with the line. Joren checked cam locks again and found one collar warm. He backed it off and blew grit from the seal. He reset the pin and looked up at Hale, who had watched the move without comment and gave him a nod that landed warm.

Wind built toward noon. Dust lifted in sheets and then fell in confusion as gusts crossed. Rane called a short pause to sweep grit from the pump console and the gauge faces. Dax turned the tripod into the breeze to keep fines out of the breech. Draeven walked the hose arc and added two more sand screws where the line wanted to lift.

They had the ring working like a good shop by lunch when three figures crested a low ridge and walked down toward the beacons with a practiced swagger. They wore long coats with stiff collars and badges made of stamped metal that caught light like a lure. Their boots left clean prints. A fourth walked behind with a small slate and a bag that rattled faintly, as if coins counted themselves when the strap moved.

Hale stepped to the pump head with her shield clipped and her gloves loose at the fingers. She kept both hands visible and her weight calm. Dax watched the ridge beyond them and let the tripod sit quiet as a reminder that men plan for more than one conversation. Joren wiped his hands on his pants and set his feet a little wider because he preferred a stable stance when talk turns into tests.

The lead man stopped at the edge of Point One and lifted his chin. He wore a beard cut thin along the jaw and a pair of glasses that held more style than function. He looked at the pump, the line, the tanks, and then the people who stood by them.

"You draw from Megnar's flats," he opened, voice smooth. "You draw from our ground. Our office collects the extraction fee and posts your permit. That keeps order and keeps men honest."

Rane stepped forward from the pump shadow with her slate in hand and a face built for patient conversations. She kept her voice friendly and flat. "We carry an interstellar water rights license under the Compact," she replied. "We publish draw rates, return gray as agreed, and pay usage to treaty ports. We work clean and keep distance from local taps when possible."

The man's mouth pulled at one corner like a line catching on a nail. "The Compact reads well on long screens," he returned. "The edge writes its own script. Our office sets fees, posts permits, and handles disputes. That keeps families fed and keeps machines from rusting under thirst."

Draeven walked up from the header and stopped where he could watch hands and eyes with equal care. He lifted a small folder and withdrew a laminated sheet with signatures that looked formal without inviting debate. "Here is our license, our draw plan, and our emergency relief note," he answered. "We deliver water to a ship with closed-loop systems under repair. We log draw and publish numbers. We pay lawful invoices to recognized authorities. Your office brings a starport stamp and a bank line, and we will pay your fee on the pier with a receipt in the ledger."

The man lifted his hand and the clerk behind him raised the slate for a neat flourish. "Our office prints the receipt here," the man countered. "We stamp with the seal that matters in this basin. The surcharge applies when work begins without a visit, because visits cost time, and time costs food."

Hale watched his fingers more than his face. They moved lightly when he spoke, and the nails held the faint grit of a person who writes more than he lifts. The clerk's bag rattled again. Coins moved when he shifted his weight, as if sound would seduce them into hands. She felt the gloves flex at a twitch and then ease when her arm settled. She breathed once and let the air leave slow.

"We keep work moving," Rane replied, tone steady. "We share water with your lead clinics if children show signs of heat stress. We log and post draw rates. We recognize starport offices for fees. We stand clear of men who carry badges with their own names on them."

A younger man at the side shifted his stance and scowled because the line grazed his pride. The leader lifted two fingers and the scowl eased, which told Dax that someone here liked discipline enough to keep hot heads from writing bills. He relaxed the muscles that matter and left the rest ready.

The man studied Rane and the ring for a long breath. He saw the tripod without letting his eyes land on it. He saw Hale's gloves without knowing the story behind them. He read Joren's stance and judged him steady. He played his next line with a tone that people mistake for patience.

"You work with purpose," he allowed. "Purpose earns respect. Fees keep records straight. These flats carry rules written by people who carry barrels upstairs. Our office visits again at sundown. We discuss surcharge and schedule then. Bring a number that reflects the hassle."

Draeven met the man's eyes and kept his own voice calm. "We pay on lawful invoices that carry starport stamps and bank lines," he repeated. "We do not trade scrip for permission to breathe."

The man's jaw tightened and then smoothed because he wanted to keep his hour pretty. He lifted his chin toward the ridges. "The edge watches its own books," he told them. "We return at sundown with a revised figure. Bring your respect for our office and save your breath for your pumps. Surcharge grows when talks run long."

He turned on his heel and walked back up the ridge with the other two moving in time. The clerk jogged behind and kept the bag from rattling with a hand that showed habit and annoyance. Dust wrapped their boots and fell behind them in a line that looked like a bad promise.

Hale let her shoulders ease and kept her eyes on the ridgeline until the last hat dipped out of sight. Dax breathed through his nose and ran his hand along the tripod's rear leg again, as if he could prime patience with touch. Joren checked the gauge and brought the needle back to the line with one careful adjustment. Draeven watched the shadow of a cloud cross the flats and filed the man's face with two words: practiced extortion.

Rane updated the ship. "Local office approached with fee demand," she reported. "We presented Compact license and draw plan. They declined formalities and promised a return at sundown to renegotiate with surcharges. We continue the work and hold a clean ring."

Colvern answered with a short pause that sounded like thought. "Logged," she returned. "We finish the lift for this window. Legal drafts a notice for starport records. Wardens hold perimeter and keep tempers cool. We grease the beacons and make the schedule pay."

Patel crouched at the pump and checked the mesh for grit again. "Flow holds," she announced. "Let them talk into wind. Our numbers buy the day."

Rane nodded and walked the ring once more. She tapped each beacon and watched each strobe acknowledge. She placed two more stakes along the path to the shuttle and hung reflective tape that flashed at eye height. She wanted the next approach to pass through a bright hall rather than a shadowy drift. Bright rooms keep hands honest.

Hale rolled her shoulders and fell back into the pump rhythm. Dax watched the ridge that sat downstream of the wind and marked three places where a man with a rifle would hide. Joren wiped grit from the cam locks, then ran the hose arc through his hands like a rigger checking a line before a heavy pull. Draeven walked the shuttle line and spoke with the pilots about a fast lift if weather and men both turned.

The sun climbed. Heat rose. Water moved into tanks that smelled like clean metal and steady work. The ring held. The locals had their story and their hunger. Wardens had their plan and their hands. Sundown would bring more words. The pumps would bring more gallons. The flats would test everyone with wind and grit. The day would keep score in tanks and in tempers.
