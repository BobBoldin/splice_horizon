Chapter 31 - Greenlight

The Greenlight Lounge kept its name honest: glass tubes poured a soft green over everything so bottles looked colder and skin looked rested, and the floor lights pulsed like a slow heartbeat that never asked for attention yet kept time for anyone who wanted it. Aria Mbeki and Keon Alvarez took a corner booth on the mezzanine where you could watch the steps to the dance floor and the line of the bar without having eyes on your back. The music leaned into bass and breath. The booths were deep enough that conversation stayed yours unless you wanted it shared. A server slid two tall glasses onto the table with a brief nod and moved on. Greenlight worked from the assumption that people knew why they were here.

Aria checked the service slate propped between the napkins and the salt. She wore a thin dark shirt that fit close across ribs she had earned with work, sleeves rolled to the elbow, grease clean except for one faint mark near the wrist she had missed in the wash. Her braid sat tight at the crown. There was a small white scar at the point of her shoulder where a wrench had slipped last winter and left a neat line. The green wash caught that line and made it a little more honest. She lifted her glass, took a measured drink, and set it down where the condensation ring would not reach the slate.

"Harrow Reach posted the crew request," she opened. "Beacon placement and a tow-line anchor under drift. Two responders, one rigger, one winch chief, one medic. They want a hull tech who does not throw tools when the EM spikes."

Keon tried the top inch of his drink and let it sit in his mouth for a count before he swallowed. He wore a gray shirt with a collar gone soft from ship washers, broad shoulders under fabric that had seen better days, and forearms marked by rope burn turned to pale lines. He carried himself like a man who counted twice and pulled once. "You fit that last part," he returned. "I can be your rigger if I put it in writing that I will not make you chase me for a dropped shackle."

"In writing and on paper," Aria replied. She rubbed her thumb along the callus at the base of her middle finger, a little unconscious check she did before any job. "They are issuing the new coupler with dosage control. Triplex scan before it fires. If the amber marker shows, it will not start. Base mesh windows get posted with usage limits. Anchor protocol if anyone throws a spike."

"Good," Keon nodded. "I do not want to wrestle a tow in drift with someone growing a third line because their windows overlapped by mistake. New coupler means we lose the excuse of ignorance."

Aria leaned back into the booth. "Brief is at ten. Short windows only. Cooldown kits on belt. If the scan goes positive, the device refuses to light. The medic or team lead carries the trigger on taper. No debate in the field."

"We stick to it," Keon agreed. "No hero moves. Let the device do the numbers. Let the medic pull the lever if we cross a line."

She traced a slow arc in the condensation on her glass and watched the drop fall. "What are you thinking for adjustments."

"For Harrow," he counted on his fingers, "lactate tuning for steady hands, light fascial reinforcement at shoulders and hips so the harness does not chew me when the load bites, and a little oxygen debt handling for the long clips between anchors. No thermal push. We are not cooking in vents."

Aria worked her own list out loud because she liked the way his face paid attention when she thought. "Grip reinforcement that does not numb the palm. Micro-tremor reduction because beacon throw under EM drift is touchy. Same small oxygen bump. No cognitive anything. I want quiet strength that gets me across the field and back with all my tools."

He tilted his glass toward hers. "Quiet strength."

She touched his glass with hers. "I like quiet strength," she returned.

They let the talk sit and watched the room a minute. Two mechanics tried to dance near the stair. Their mag-walk boots were locked off, but their bodies still remembered the sway of a deck, so each step had caution built into it. The bartender lined four bottles in a row and poured with a steady hand that made a thin curve look easy. A couple at the far booth leaned close, foreheads almost touching as if the last inch were a private border they enjoyed guarding. Aria felt the week drop off her shoulders like a weight she could set under the table. Long shifts had a way of stealing your voice. Greenlight gave it back without asking what you planned to do with it.

"They tightened the house rules," Keon mentioned. He watched the floor, not scanning, just letting his eyes collect what they needed. "No filming. Clear consent. If someone says stop, staff hears it and you go home alone. It has kept the fights down."

"I like rules that work," Aria replied. She took another drink and set the glass down. The soft green caught the line of her collarbone, and the fabric at her waist rose and fell slow as she breathed. She shifted in the booth and stretched one leg under the table until the inside of her calf found his shin. Warmth met warmth through cloth. She held it there, then drew a small circle with the edge of her boot against his ankle. "So why are we here tonight, Alvarez. We could have covered Harrow Reach in the morning and saved the credits."

"Because off-shift should mean something," he answered. He set his elbows on the table and leaned in a fraction. His eyes stayed on hers. "Because I like the way you look when you are not counting anchor points."

Her mouth tilted. She slid her hand under the table and rested it on his knee, fingers rough from mag-walk days. She kept it light at first to see if he tensed, then pressed just above the tendon until he stilled. "You like the way I look," she murmured. "Be specific."

"The braid tucked tight," he listed, voice even. "The grease line you missed near your wrist. The way your hips sit square when you decide you are done being polite. The small scar at your shoulder that tells the truth about how you work."

Aria's thumb moved along the seam of his pants and stopped, not teasing, just clear. "Good start," she replied. "And I like your knots, and that your shoulders hold a load without shaking, and how you wait for my count before you pull."

He drew a breath and let it out slow. She held his knee and added a second point of contact with her knee, a gentle squeeze that wrote intent without turning the booth into a scene. The room went on around them like a tide that was not their problem. Her hand stayed where it was. His hand slid across the table, palm up, fingers open, not reaching for her without an ask.

"Greenlight is honest," Aria went on, tone low. "We finish our drinks. You walk me. We keep it kind, we keep it safe, and we do not pretend this is nothing in the morning."

"Copy," Keon returned.

She stroked up his thigh an inch and back down to his knee, all through fabric and within the bounds they had set. "What would you tune if the night needed it," she asked. The tilt in her voice made it more than a field check.

"Grip that holds and lets go when asked," he answered. "Shoulders strong enough to lift and not strain. Breath that lasts until both of us finish what we start."

Her smile reached her eyes and made the green light kinder. "I was thinking knotwork with a soft release and a guarantee against rope burn."

"I have certifications," he replied, deadpan.

"I will need documentation," she countered, equally straight.

They both laughed, and then left the laugh behind without losing the current. Aria took her hand back and sipped. The drink bit, then warmed, then let go. She watched his face and found the calm that had made her notice him the first time they shared a bay: the way he checked a load on instinct, the way he moved when the line sang, the way his hands kept pace with hers without turning it into a contest.

"You grew up bayside or shipboard," she asked, more curious than cautious.

"Shipboard," he answered. "My mother was a deck medic. My father ran winches. I learned hand signals before I learned words. You."

"Station girl," she returned. "Walked ducts and read labels for fun. Took apart a panel when I was eight because the hum changed and it made me angry. Put it back together before anyone noticed. Got caught anyway. Paid for it by cleaning the same panel for a month."

He grinned. "That tracks."

"It does," she agreed. "You ever try to stop a piece of your brain from counting when the music starts."

"Every time," he admitted. "It never stops. I just make it count different things."

She looked at the dance floor. The music had shifted to a slower line that let bodies find each other without having to invent a reason. "Show me," she invited.

He lifted a brow. "Now."

She nodded once. "Now."

They left the booth and set their glasses where the server could see them and not clear them by mistake. The stairs took three steps to adjust to the deeper bass. The floor gave a soft return under their weight. Keon set one palm at the small of her back, not a push, just a placement to keep their bodies aligned. Aria let him have it and set her hand on his shoulder where fabric met skin and muscle worked under it. Her hips lined with his. They let the first measure pass without moving so they could feel where the count sat in this room and not the next. Then they stepped. He kept it simple: a slow sway, a quarter-turn, a step back that kept her balanced, a return that let her chest brush his without turning it into a show. She followed with more confidence than caution, letting her body read him the way she read a winded line: pressure, release, risk, promise.

"Better than the mechanics," she whispered, mouth near his ear.

"They have their own gifts," he breathed back, smiling.

Aria slid her leg between his and drew it back, a small test. He adjusted without losing time. She did it again, higher this time, and let her knee press into his thigh. His inhale hit her neck, warm air against skin that had been under ship light all day. She closed her eyes for one count and then opened them so she would not get lost in her own head. The music dropped once, then rose, then veered left. They moved with it like they were walking a deck in swell, not fighting for balance, simply aware that the floor sometimes plays games.

A woman brushed Aria's shoulder and gave her a look that would have been a challenge in another place, but here read as appreciation and a ghost of a compliment. Aria let it pass. Keon's hand slid down her back to the top of her hip and rested, not a grab. She placed her hand over his and pressed once. He took the cue and kept it there.

"Sunfan heat makes people social," he murmured. "Strong drinks and weak morals do the rest."

"Speak for your morals," she returned, amused. "Mine are firm. I want what I want. I will not pretend otherwise."

"Firm is good," he replied.

They danced until the song ended and they did not try to make a bow out of it. They stepped off the floor and back to the booth. Her breath had lifted and settled. His collar was open at the throat where he had not bothered to button the top all the way. The server had not cleared their glasses. Aria drained hers and set it down with care. She glanced at the time and made a little face at the hour, then ignored it.

"House rules," she reminded him. She ticked them off on her fingers. "Hydration first. No spacer myths. No hero stories. We keep it simple and we keep it kind. If anything does not feel right, we call it and stop."

"Copy," he repeated. "We also check in tomorrow and do not pretend tonight never happened."

"Copy that," she returned.

She pressed her calf against his again under the table and left it there. Then she moved her hand to his thigh and drew a straight line from knee to mid-leg and back, slow enough that the heat had time to answer. He looked at her hand and then at her face to make sure he did not miss a change of mind. She met his eyes and let him see that she was not a woman who used a touch to test a man's attention and then punished him for noticing. She moved her thumb in a small circle at his knee and stopped.

"You have a room that locks from the inside," she asked.

"I do," he replied.

"We are not going to talk about anchors unless we mean actual wall fixtures," she added, light but clear. "I am not putting a bolt in my headboard."

"Only factory-rated attachment points and manufacturer-approved loads," he promised.

"Good answer."

They left credits on the table and walked out. The corridor outside ran cooler, the air a little cleaner, the light white instead of green. The shift from lounge to ship felt like stepping over a line you could see. Aria took his hand, turned it palm up, and traced a slow circle with her thumb at the heel as if she were marking a place on a map no one else needed to read. He flexed his fingers once and then let his hand relax so she could do it again.

"Tell me one thing you want," he asked as they walked. His voice kept it curious rather than hungry.

"A kiss that starts soft and does not rush the rest of it," she answered. "Your shoulders under my hands. Your breath even with mine. If there is rope, I pick it. If there is a knot, it releases when I say."

"Done," he replied. "Tell me if you want more."

"I will," she returned. "Tell me if anything feels off."

"I will."

They reached the lift. He did not touch her back until the door closed and the car started up, then he placed two fingers lightly against her spine and slid them away again. She glanced at the security plate and watched their reflection for a heartbeat. She saw a woman who knew what she wanted and a man who looked steady enough to meet her there. The door opened. The corridor turned left. Two crew passed with a cart and an inside joke that made them both grin. Keon keyed his door. It locked behind them with a sound you could trust.

Aria turned and kissed him the way she had ordered: soft at first, no rush, a little pressure to show intent, a little pull to make room for a second try. He matched her pace without trying to prove anything. His hands went to her waist and held with a grip that made space for breath. She set her palms on his shoulders and pressed, then relaxed, then pressed again. He did not move until she did. She stepped back half a step and smiled.

"Water," she reminded, nodding at the galley.

He filled two cups. They drank. They set the cups down side by side. He reached for a small bag and pulled out a clean length of soft line and set it on the counter without making it a performance. She picked it up and ran it through her fingers. No burrs. No rough spots. She tied a small loop and pulled it, then released it with a single touch. It came apart without a fight.

"Certified," she approved.

He breathed a laugh. "Documentation complete."

She took his hand again and led him toward the bed. The bedding was plain and clean. The room smelled like soap and warm metal. No tools. No clutter. She turned back to face him and let her hair down. The braid slid into a rope that fell over her shoulder. He watched her and did not reach until she nodded once. He raised his hand and traced the small white scar at her shoulder with his fingertip. She did not flinch. She took his wrist and set his palm flat against her back.

"No spacer myths," she reminded, voice low. "No hero stories."

"Only house rules," he answered.

She leaned in and kissed him again, deeper now, the kind that warms the chest and quiets the counting part of the brain. His hands stayed where she placed them. Her hands moved where she wanted them. The night had a direction. They would follow it at the pace they chose. Harrow Reach could wait for morning. Tonight was breath and bodies and the steady kind of heat two people can carry without breaking anything they would need tomorrow.
