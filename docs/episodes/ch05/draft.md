Chapter 05 -- The Catch after The Catch

"Evening on Recreation Deck Three at the Greenlight, where music rides low and the lights make copper out of glass."

Rhea Halden slid into a booth with her gloves clipped at her belt and her shoulders finally loose. The table was cool under her palms. Condensation slid down a tall glass and left a wet ring that looked honest after a long day. Across from her, Nyra Solwyn unwound a scarf and shook out a few curls like a person returning to herself.

Nyra lifted her glass. "First sip. To steady hands and quiet rooms."

Halden touched rim to rim. "And to work that ends when you say it ends." They drank. The sour met the sweet and drew a clean line of flavor that matched the low drum in the room.

They watched the traffic for a moment. A service drone drifted past the viewport and winked a small green. At the bar, a pair of deckhands argued softly about a card play, then laughed and split a plate. Music sat warm in the air, all low strings and brushed skins.

Nyra leaned in. "All right. We promised ourselves one night where we talk like people and not job titles. Start the game. Two interests and one dare."

Halden smiled with her eyes and let the day slip a little farther away. "Two interests. Dax Rovell and Paxen Morrow."

Nyra lifted a brow. "Dax and Paxen. That is a tidy list. Reasons?"

"Dax moves like he knows who else is in the room. He can be bright when he earns it, not before. He watches a dial, then watches a face, then makes a choice. That tells me he can listen when timing matters."

"And Paxen?" Nyra sounded pleased.

"Paxen is gentle with equipment and does not make a speech about it. He puts weight down where it belongs. He makes doors close soft. I like men who treat the small things with care."

Nyra tapped the rim of her glass. "You like men who do not show off."

"I like men who can stand still long enough to notice what is in their hands."

Nyra's smile ran for a second longer than polite. "My turn. Two interests. Paxen Morrow, since you said his name, and Captain Draeven when he remembers to breathe." She lifted a palm to head off the look. "No, I am not collecting stripes. I like the way he lowers his voice when people are afraid. It makes space."

Halden laughed under her breath. "You and your soft spots."

"I like men who can stand beside fear without feeding it. Paxen, because he keeps a latch steady without checking who is watching. That is attractive."

"Agreed." Halden leaned back, relaxing now, and let her easy scan drift across the room. "Now the part that makes the night interesting. One dare each."

Nyra set her glass down with care. "For you. Dax will come in later with his post-shift grin. You will ask him to the practice rail. No talk about work until you reach the harness. Then you will put his hands on the bar and you will say, hold for ten breaths. If he counts with you without trying to lead, you owe him a slow song next week. If he rushes, you owe him a cup of tea and a story about patience."

Halden let the image live in her head. It looked good there. "That is fair. For you. Paxen will be easy to find. He stays near the door when he is off duty because he likes to be useful. You will ask him to stand at the viewport for one full track. First minute, no shop talk. You will let the silence do the work. If he fills it with kindness, you will ask him to choose the next song. If he fills it with weather and nothing else, you will say good night and keep your map for someone who reads."

Nyra's eyes warmed. "You are ruthless in the right ways."

Halden considered and agreed. "Only on your behalf."

They let the room breathe around them. Ice clicked. Cloth brushed cloth. Somewhere, someone's laugh rose and then softened when a friend put a hand on a shoulder.

Nyra glanced at Halden's fingers on the glass. "How is the hand?" The question was quiet, not a moment made of it.

"Light tonight." Halden lifted the glass, set it down, and watched the small muscles at the base of her thumb behave. "Four in, two out. It listens when I do."

Nyra nodded once and let the subject pass. "Tell me what you like first. Face, hands, voice, the way a man stands when he thinks no one can see."

"Hands. Forearms too. Not size. Control. I like to see a jaw relax when a job is done well. I like a man who asks before he touches. I like a clean neck above a collar. No perfume. Soap and metal and a little heat."

Nyra looked toward the bar with a slow, amused scan. "Face and voice for me. A voice that does not rush. Eyes that look at the person speaking, not at their reflection in the glass. Shoulders that drop when the tension is over. And yes to the ask before the touch."

"We are plain about what we want."

"We are women who work. Plain is useful. Innuendo is a spice, not a meal."

They grinned at each other like conspirators.

The door admitted a small shift of cooler air and two figures stepped through. Dax Rovell moved first, hair still damp from a quick wash, sleeves rolled, a new scrape on one knuckle. He scanned the room, saw friends at a side table, started that way, then stopped and pulled a slim slate from his jacket.

Paxen Morrow followed with the easy posture of a man who trusts his balance. He carried a folded linen and the same quiet focus he used with a cart. He spoke to the host, got a nod, and stood to one side so a couple could pass.

Nyra blinked once and laughed under her breath. "You have a good sense for timing."

"Practice." Halden smoothed her sleeve and kept her chin soft.

Dax caught Nyra's eye and lifted the slate. He reached the booth. "You left this on the rail after the briefing. I would not want your notes walking off."

"Thank you." Nyra took the slate and let her fingers brush his for a second. "You saved me a return trip."

Paxen offered a small bow with no flourish. "Good evening. I am off doors and carts for an hour."

Halden liked the clean way he said it. She tipped her chin. "Sit a minute."

Dax glanced at the open half of the booth. "May we?"

"You may." Nyra shifted the glasses to make space.

They slid in. The bench gave a soft sound as it took the new weight. A server set down two waters without being asked.

"How was the rest of your day?" Nyra asked.

"Steady." Paxen folded his scarf and set it beside him. "Moved a cart, fixed a squeak, kept out of the way when people were busy. It feels good to sit."

Dax rubbed the back of one knuckle with his thumb. "Short, then long. The short part was the roll to the gate. The long part was waiting while the bay cleared. I do not mind the waiting. It keeps me honest."

Halden nodded at his hand. "You got that scrape today."

"Yes. It is clean."

"Good." She let her eyes stay on his for half a beat. "You look better out of the helmet."

Nyra hid a smile in her glass and turned to Paxen. "You look like a man who likes quiet rooms."

"I like rooms where people do not have to raise their voices. This one is good."

The song drifted toward its end. Glass touched wood. Somewhere a chair ticked on tile and then settled. A vent changed pitch and went back again. Nyra filed the detail away without comment.

"Tell us one simple thing you like after a long day." She looked to both men. "Not a story. A thing."

"Salt on food that did not start in a field pack. A clean shirt. Music that does not try to win," Dax said.

"Warm light. A chair that sits level. Seeing people breathe easier when work is done," Paxen said.

Halden lifted her water and took a slow sip. "Hands that do not fidget when they are not needed." Her eyes stayed on Dax. "That is my thing."

Dax held her look and did not fidget. "I can do that."

Nyra turned her glass in a small circle and watched a clear ring appear. "I like a man who asks before he reaches." She let the words sit, then met Paxen's eyes. "And a man who can stand still without going blank."

"I can ask. And I can stand still."

The song changed and the room shifted in that small way rooms do when the band turns a page. No one hurried. No one reached.

"Another round?" Dax asked. "Or water first?"

"Water first. We have time," Halden said.

Paxen lifted his glass. "To time, then."

They drank. The talk turned easy. Small pieces of the day, the way the bay smelled clean again after the sprayers, the cook who salted like he meant it, the new stool at the end of the bar that did not wobble. Nyra asked Dax what track he put on when he was off duty and wanted his shoulders to drop. Halden asked Paxen if he liked to sit near a window or a wall. Answers came simple and true.

The next song began warm and low. They stayed where they were and let it carry the talk forward.

The server brought a small plate without being asked. Olives, thin bread, a curl of cheese. Nyra thanked him and slid the plate to the middle so no one had to reach across anyone else.

Dax tore a strip of bread, dipped it, and looked up. "You two did good work today. Field felt steady."

Nyra's mouth softened. "That is kind. Steady is what I try to give." She watched him bite and swallow. The line of his throat moved once, clean and sure. It pleased her more than it should have, and she let herself enjoy it.

Halden took an olive and set the pit on a napkin. "You kept your hands where they belonged." She meant Dax. "That is what I notice."

"I worked for it. I can work for it again."

Paxen folded the napkin edge with two fingers, precise without fuss. "I watched from the bay door. I liked the quiet after the latch hit." He caught himself. "After the door closed. It sounded right."

A glass wobbled on a nearby tray. The server made a small save, and Paxen steadied the edge with one palm as it passed. It was quick, simple, done before anyone could thank him. The server's eyes said thank you anyway. Paxen lifted two fingers in answer and let it be.

Nyra saw the move and did not praise him for it. She took a sip and sat a little straighter. "Tell me what music you like when you are alone."

"Low guitars. Songs where the singer is not trying to win."

"Same. I like a voice that remembers there are listeners."

Dax glanced at Halden's hand on her glass. "How is your day after the gate?" The question stayed plain.

"Light." Halden lifted and set the glass once. The small muscles behaved. "The count works when I do."

"Good. I like the count too."

A couple at the bar laughed at a joke and the room answered with a soft ripple. The lights shifted a shade warmer. The vent changed pitch and then settled. Nyra felt the drift and let it pass.

"Do you dance?" She asked Paxen, casual.

"If asked." He considered it. "Badly at first. Better when I figure out where to put my feet."

"I can tell you where to put them." Nyra smiled into her glass.

Dax rested his forearms on the table. Skin and fine hair caught the copper light. Halden looked once and let herself look again. He noticed and did not make a joke of it.

"Do you train much when you are off shift?" she asked.

"Often. Short sets. I like the rail. It teaches me faster than a mirror."

Halden's mouth turned at the corners. "I feel the same. The rail tells the truth."

The song thinned to a last brush on skins. The next track was slower, with a little space around the notes. The room leaned toward it without thinking.

Nyra set her glass down and smoothed a curl behind her ear. "I would like to stretch my legs when this is through." She looked to the table, then to Paxen last. "I favor the long window."

"I like the long window." He did not add more.

Halden finished her water. She wiped a drop from her lip with the back of one knuckle. "I will check the practice deck after closing." She looked at Dax. "I usually start with a quiet walk."

"I can walk," Dax said.

They let the silence settle. It was not awkward; it carried the anticipation of what might come next and needed no words.

Nyra turned to Halden. "Tell me one more thing you like. Face, hands, voice."

"Hands." Halden shifted to Dax. "Yours are telling me the right story."

Color climbed Dax's cheekbones and stayed. He did not glance at the window to check himself. He kept his eyes where they belonged.

Nyra moved her knee so it brushed Paxen's under the table. He did not jump. He made room, then looked at her to be sure the room was hers to make. It was.

The server refilled waters. Someone at the bar ordered a citrus peel and the bright smell lifted and fell. The song held a long note, then let it go.

Nyra stood and took her scarf. "I will be back." She faced Paxen without flourish. "Walk with me."

Paxen rose. "Yes."

They slipped into the slow current toward the viewport, shoulders close, not touching unless the room asked for it.

Dax watched them go and then looked back to Halden. "Do you want anything before we head out? Water for the road."

"Water is good," Halden said.

He raised a hand. The server brought two short glasses and a small smile that said the night was going the way nights should. Dax set one glass near Halden's hand and kept one for himself.

"Last song, then the deck," Halden said.

"Last song," Dax said, settling in without hurry.

They listened. The music did not try to win. The room breathed like a body that had done its work and was glad of the rest. When the track closed, they stood without fuss. Halden clipped her gloves at her belt and let Dax see that she was ready. He answered with a nod and an easy step that matched hers.

They left the booth as if the table had wished them well. The low light carried them toward the corridor, where the floor hummed and the air smelled faintly of lemon and steel.
