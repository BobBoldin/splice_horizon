Chapter 01 - First Cut

"Recording is on." Doctor Elias Tharros said. "The procedure is a standard vascular repair in a Spiral positive adolescent. Proceed."

He extended his hand. "Scalpel."

Cold metal met his palm. The scrub nurse placed it without looking up; antiseptic and warm plastic perfumed the air while the handlers whispered across the ceiling haze.

"At baseline." The anesthetist reported from the head of the table. "Pressure in range, oxygenation good."

"Clamp."

"Clamp set."

"Mesh."

"Bioinert mesh." The nurse confirmed, already presenting the packet.

The operative field became its own small world: clean light; cottonâ€‘blue drape; the disciplined red that meant life when it stayed contained. Elias kept his tone even for the recorder. "Field is clear. Advancing the mesh with gentle pressure, then hold."

The resident stood at his shoulder, gloves whispering as he shifted. "Doctor, how are you aligning around the Spiral weakness?"

"Think of a zipper." Elias eased the lattice into place. "Healthy tissue has teeth that catch. Spiral Atrophy erodes those teeth. If the grip fails, the line looks closed until it moves."

"A small dip in perfusion." The anesthetist noted, calm and precise. "Trend not yet sustained."

"I see it. Suction."

A thin, steady note rose as the tip cleared the field. "Second clamp."

"Second clamp set."

The suction tip sang a thin, steady note. The scent of iron rose and faded as the field cleared. The resident exhaled. His breath fogged the lower edge of his face shield and he pulled back a finger width.

"Don't celebrate just yet." Elias murmured. "The lattice must couple or it won't hold."

The monitor gave a soft chirp and the timbre shifted. The sound stayed low and clear enough to guide him..

"There is a new bleed." He adjusted angle and depth. "The source is not in plane."

The scrub nurse placed fresh pads into his waiting hand. The pads made a quiet thud as they took weight. The light shifted a shade cooler when the overhead unit compensated for his angle.

"Pressure is falling." the anesthetist warned. "It is a clear trend."

"Packing. Tighter. Hold the light. A little more to the left. There."

The resident swallowed. The sound was audible in the mask. "Should I call a code, Doctor?"

"Not yet, give me more suction."

"Suction."

"Clamp." He said again, quieter, as if the field could hear intention.

The monitor slipped from a steady metronome into a hesitant rhythm that tried to be brave and could not. The tone flattened for a breath, then rose, then staggered in a pattern that meant the body was losing its argument with the wound.

"Doctor." The anesthetist started but did not finish the sentence.

"Increase fluids." Elias kept his eyes on the field. "Warm them. Keep me informed."

"Fluids increasing. Warmer set."

Elias searched for the plane of the tear. Blood is not a single color in the field. It browns when it pools, it brightens when it runs, it turns almost black under the shadow edge of a glove. He followed the brighter edge, lifted the mesh a fraction, and felt the refusal through the instrument. The tissue would not take the help. He had taught this maneuver to others. He had performed it a hundred times, probably more. It felt correct. It just did not work like it should have.

"Do you want a larger scaffold?" the resident asked, voice going thin.

"No." was the response. "We want purchase, not mass."

He steadied his hands at the edge of the field. The gloves squeaked when he eased pressure. A faint tremor touched the lintel as the building's ventilation shifted with the deepening night. The ship would have called this ordinary. The body under his hands felt every small change.

"Pressure is now low." the anesthetist said. "His heart rate is irregular."

"Pressors." Elias directed. "One small dose. Call the supervisor on standby."

"Pressors given. Supervisor paged."

The resident's voice was nearly a squeak. "Doctor, I request permission to call a code."

Elias fixed the clamp, released the second clamp to test, saw a small hope, and watched it slide. "Permission granted." he said with a sigh.

The room did not become louder. It became focused. Footsteps approached from the door with purpose and stopped at the clean line where they must stop. The code cart clicked against the wall magnets. The supervisor's voice joined the room and braided into the others.

"Status."

"Spiral positive adolescent." Elias said. "Standard repair with mesh. Lattice is not coupling. Persistent micro tear out of plane. We are losing pressure despite clamps and packing."

"Understood."

Elias tried once more. He shifted the angle a hair. His instrument hand shaped the field with authority and patience. The blood answered with indifference, then with certainty. The monitor's last rhythm stretched into a line that did not move.

"Time of death." came the call from the supervisor. The number went into the air and into the archive.

No one spoke for a moment. The pads were lifted away, one by one, with care equal to the care given when they arrived. Instruments went to their trays, counted aloud in calm voices, because even at the end of a case that had ended, the ritual had to be whole.

"Thank you." Elias spoke to the room. His voice sounded like someone had stepped into it and borrowed it. "Recording off."

He left the field, and the world narrowed to the sound of running water and the feel of thin soap on his hands. The scrub sink was a long, stainless trough. It was built to carry away effort and return stillness. The water ran warm first, then cooled, and he let it cool. The smell of antiseptic lifted away and left the simpler smell of metal and water. He flexed his fingers under the stream and watched the tendons under the glove press and release like pale cords under a clear river.

He removed the gloves and washed again. The skin of his hands was steady. The steadiness felt like a person he had met once and did not entirely trust. He placed his forehead against the clean tile. The tile held the night air and gave it back to him. The rhythm of the operating room still lived in his ears. Chirp, hush, suction, breath. The boy's mother would be waiting in a chair with a cup of tea that tasted of paper and patience. He pictured her face when hope rearranged itself into grief. It would be a small change at first, then a total one.

Elias turned the water off. The room was quiet in a way that felt like a decision.

He dried his hands and stepped into the hall. The hall was bright, and that brightness felt like a mercy because it did not pretend to understand him. A clerk from the Selection Center waited with a slate and a stack of printed pages. The clerk had patient eyes, the kind of eyes that had learned how to be neutral.

"Doctor Tharros." the clerk said. "I was told to bring these after your case. They are the Venture Bond forms. The ship is filling berths this quarter."

"Here?" Elias questioned. "Now."

"Yes, Doctor." the clerk responded. "If you prefer, I can return in the morning."

"Now is fine."

They moved to a small office off the corridor. The office held a table, two chairs, and a recorder that looked older than the rest of the building. The clerk set the pages down and turned the recorder on.

"Please confirm your name."

"Elias Tharros."

"Please confirm the vessel."

"Colonial Ship Vessel Meridian."

"Please confirm your understanding of the Charter highlights. Article Seven. Human Integrity. No spouse or child in clinical trials. Article Twelve. Non weaponization. No field deployment of splices without emergency override by the Continuance Council. Article Three. Open Benefit. Any successful therapy must scale to the colony."

"I understand them." Elias confirmed. He could hear the soap on his skin, a faint tack where the towel had missed a place at the base of his thumb.

"Please confirm the term of service."

"Twenty five years."

The pen was heavier than a pen needed to be. Elias initialed page after page. His letters were small and exact. The sound of the nib on paper was the quiet scratch of someone making a promise he fully expects to keep and fully understands will cost him.

The clerk nodded, switched off the recorder, and slid a copy of the bond into a file. "Welcome to the Initiative, Doctor Tharros."

Elias stood. The floor under his shoes had a slight give, as if the building remembered footsteps and softened itself in respect. He did not trust the feeling. He trusted the weight of the pages in his hand, the smell of the scrub sink on his skin, and the memory of the monitor changing its voice when the body decided that it was finished. He turned toward the corridor where the family rooms waited and the tea would be cold by now.

"Later that same night, inside the family kitchen."

The room held the quiet sounds a home makes when most of the city has gone to sleep. The cooler clicked once and settled. Pipes inside the wall carried a steady breath. A clock on the shelf made a soft tick that sounded older than the building.

Liora sat at the table with a blanket around her shoulders. A single lamp warmed the wood. Steam rose from a cup and made a thin veil in the light.

"I heard the door. You are late." Was her greeting

"I stayed at the hospital." He set a small stack of pages on the table. "I spoke with the advocate and I finished the paperwork."

"Hands first." Her gaze dropped to his palms.

He opened them. The skin showed the faint crosshatch from scrubbing. The knuckles were pale from heat and soap. His fingers did not shake.

"They look steady, but do they feel like yours?" Her concern obvious in the question.

"They feel like tools I borrowed." He sat. The chair gave a low sound as it met his weight. "I keep hearing the monitor change its tone. It is a small sound, but it fills the room in my head."

Liora reached across the table and placed her fingers lightly over his fingers. "Tell me what happened."

"It was a standard repair." He began. "The field looked clean, however; the mesh would not hold. The Spiral turned a small tear into a wider one. When I tried to guide the tissue to accept support, it just kept slipping. We called the code, and even though we followed every step, we still failed and did not bring him back."

She breathed in once and out twice, the way she did when she wanted to remain calm. "OK, now say his name for me."

"Rion Anjar." Elias complied. The name felt right in his mouth and heavy in his chest. "I told his mother myself. She asked me to explain the Spiral so she could tell her family. I used simple words. I only hope they were enough."

"Go over it with me. Tell me how you explained the Spiral condition to her." The words her way of calming him at the end of his day.

"The vessels in our body normally remain whole via many tiny anchors." Elias started. "Each anchor helps the next one hold. Spiral Atrophy weakens those anchors. When I place a supportive mesh, the surface can look correct, however; when the body moves, the anchors miss each other. The repair slips. Then a small, hidden tear becomes a much larger tear. The Spiral is not just a single germ. It is a pattern that repeats itself in many small places all at once. That is why our tools, which are normally safe end up failing."

"You explained it just fine my love." Liora said affectionately. "Now, tell me about the papers you have brought home."

Elias slid the stack toward her. "The Splice Horizon Initiative. It is a chartered mission that sends families and staff to a ship called the Meridian. The purpose is to search for regenerative traits in alien life and translate those traits into stable support for human tissue. The work seeks a way to teach those tiny anchors to hold again. I signed a Venture Bond for twenty five years."

She looked at the first page, then the second, then set them down and rested both hands on top. "Tell me the parts that matter to us."

Elias summarized the documents for her. "Article Seven: No trials on spouse or child. That is the line I will not cross. Article Twelve: No field use of splices as weapons without council override. Article Three: Any successful therapy must scale to the whole colony, not to one ward or one family. The bond gives us berths because our family carries the Spiral markers. We go because we are part of the effort to end the thing that follows us."

Liora held his gaze. Her eyes were a clear green that always made him think of water that ebbs and flows. "Now that the decision has been made, how are you feeling?"

He thought for a moment. "It feels like a door that opened after a night of walking in circles. I am tired. I am angry at the limits of what I had to give. I am ashamed that I am relieved to have a next step at all. I am afraid I will fail again. I am more afraid that I will stop trying if I let myself rest."

She did not speak for a count of five. The quiet carried the tick of the clock and the thin whistle of wind outside the window. "So, what does this mean for Kaela and myself?"

His words came slowly "I will not perform a procedure on you. I will not perform a procedure on Kaela. Not until a trial reaches the phase the Charter calls Gamma. That is the point where we have durable outcomes across a score of patients."

She smiled, small and tired and real. "Then I will tell you a truth that belongs to me. I am afraid. I am also proud. I married a man who keeps his hands steady in grief. I can live with fear if your hands stay steady."

He folded his fingers around hers and felt the steady heat of her skin. The steam from the cup had thinned. The cooler clicked again. A siren far away wound up, then faded. The world did what worlds do when one household carries a heavy thing. It kept moving.

Liora released his hands and touched the top page of the bond. "When do we tell Kaela."

"Tomorrow evening." Elias said. "I want the plan clear before we give her any burden of worries to carry."

She looked warmly into his eyes. "Good. Then say one last thing to me before we go to sleep. Say what you will carry with you for Rion. Say it so the room can hear it and keep it."

His tone became firm. "I will carry his name into every model I test. I will carry his mother's face into every consent I ask. I will carry the sound of the monitor into every choice I make. When a pattern begins to hold, I will ask whether the boy on that table would have lived if I had known this then. If the answer is yes, I will teach the next person what I learned."

Liora stood and came around the table. He rose to meet her. They stood for a time without talking. The lamp hummed. The blanket slipped from her shoulder and he caught it and set it back.

"It is time for you to sleep. You will need all of it."

"I will try." Kissing her as a gentle thank you for her caring ways.

They moved through the small rituals that make a house feel safe. Cup rinsed and set to dry. Pages stacked and clipped. Light switched off with a soft click. In the doorway he paused and looked back at the table. The papers waited in a neat square. The chair still held the shape of where he had been sitting. The air held the faint smell of tea leaves and soap.

"Tomorrow." he said to the room.

He followed Liora down the hall. The city outside kept its slow breath. In the dark he could still hear the small changes of tone that live in an operating room. He did not push them away. He let them ride with him into sleep. He would wake with them, and he would carry them onto the ship.
