Chapter 30 - The Third Strand

Three weeks later, the medical bay sounded the way it should: steady vents, shoes on clean floor, trays set down with a soft click that did not break thought. Elias stood at a bench with a model he had built out of thin rods and colored clips. He did not love props, but this one kept the story clear without burying people in language. Kaela and Liora took the front stools. A senior tech waited by the hood with a tablet. The light was bright enough for work and kind enough for faces.

Elias tapped the lowest rung on the model. "Two strands," he began. "A double helix like a staircase. Two rails twisted. Rungs between. Spiral Atrophy ties to a repeat on chromosome seventeen. When the ladder loses shape there, nerves and vessels pay first. That is the tremor, the fainting, the slow drift off balance."

He lifted a narrow green filament from a dish. "Sunfan's base mesh helps because it threads the rungs and steadies them when they want to slip." He laced the green line along the inner edge of the steps, snug but not tight. "Think of it as a vine you trained where the wood was weak."

He paused until both women had a clear look. Kaela's fingers were knit, the tips pressed together hard. She watched like a student and like a daughter who had earned the right to ask anything. Liora kept her eyes on the model and on the images she wanted to see next. That was how she made room for truth without giving it a drama it did not need.

"The help comes with a cost," Elias continued. "Vines hold. Left unchecked, they choke. The base mesh does the same if you push dosage or time. It starts to bind more than the weak spots. It looks for every rung it can reach. In people who carry a splice, it tries a different trick."

He held up a third strand, amber in the light. He anchored its end under the lowest rung and settled it into the central groove. "There is a condition called triplex DNA," he went on. "Under certain scenarios a third strand can sit in the major groove using different links. It is rare, short, and unstable. What we see in the lab is the start of that line when Sunfan and a splice overlap too much in time."

Liora leaned closer. "Show me where you saw it."

The senior tech mirrored the tablet to the wall. Two frames: a blue double helix as baseline, then a faint amber signal tracing the groove in short runs. "Detainee sample," Elias noted. "The amber shows at the edge of a Sunfan window, then fades when the dose clears. We saw a weak echo in tissue from the Anvil's seam, but that sample does not let us set a clock you can trust. In Kaela's last micro-trial we saw no amber, which is exactly what we wanted."

Kaela let out a measured breath. "Because the dose was small and the window short," she offered.

"Right," he returned. "Keep the vine helpful. Do not let it get ideas about a third line."

He set both hands flat on the bench. The quick, bright force that had filled his head in the first days after his mistake had cooled to clarity he could use without burning himself or anyone else. He could hold the model and the cell line and the person in front of him at the same time. It felt like a skill he had earned, not a trick he had stolen.

"What does a stable third line mean," Liora asked. She kept her voice even. "Top level only."

"It would change the rules," Elias replied. "A third strand could carry backup instructions or act like a checksum. It could also slow the entire engine and make every edit three times as hard. We are not seeing stable third lines. We are seeing a push in that direction when Sunfan and a splice overlap. That is enough to build a warning around."

Kaela watched the amber filament a moment longer. "Two fixes talking to each other and turning the conversation bad," she murmured.

He nodded. "The body hears two sets of orders and tries to braid them. That is not skill. That is panic. The best move is to keep timing apart and keep dosage honest. One job at a time."

He slid the first model aside and showed a second: the same ladder with small gray clips where weak rungs had been reinforced. "Here is what works now," he said. "Short windows on the base mesh. A cooling strip at the neck to blunt rebounds. Food before and after in small, steady pieces. For splice work, keep it far from Sunfan's window. If you cannot, lower both."

Kaela nodded. "And if someone already carries a splice and needs the base mesh."

"Then we plan the timing boundary with care," Elias answered. "We scan for any hint of that amber signal. If it shows, we stop. We do not let short-term strength turn into long-term harm. We also remember inheritance. Spiral Atrophy already runs in families. If a third line ever stabilized, misfolds might pass in ways we cannot map yet. That alone is reason to keep a hard usage limit."

The senior tech raised the tablet a little. "You also have a coupler change."

"Yes," Elias told her. "We add a sweep for triplex markers before the coupler fires. If the amber is present, it refuses to start. That forces a timing boundary. Some field techs will curse it. It will keep a few from becoming case reports."

Liora's mouth eased a notch. "Good. Now cover the part we do not get to ignore."

Elias flipped a card on the board. The header read: Berserk Window.

"This is the part I do not like," he went on. "When a splice and the base mesh overlap too deep, some bodies do more than start a third line. They throw a surge. Pain gates drop. Motor gain climbs. Judgment narrows to a single task. If you are lifting, you lift past safe limits. If you are fighting, you do not hear stop. We have seen this outside our walls. We gave it a name so we would stop treating it like gossip."

Kaela leaned in. "Back off and you avoid it," she guessed, then frowned. "Except you cannot always back off. If someone is holding a bulkhead or a patient, you do not walk away."

"Catch twenty-two," Elias agreed. "So we design for it in a way that does not rely on willpower. Three parts."

He tapped the first line. "One: hard usage limits inside the devices. The base mesh window and the coupler both check for triplex markers. If the scan is positive, they refuse to fire. That prevents the overlap from starting."

"Two," he continued, "when the work will not wait and you have to risk an overlap, you carry a cooldown kit. It is a short stack: a neck strip to drop core a notch, a metered nasal spray that blunts the adrenergic spike in under thirty seconds, and a clip patch behind the ear that tells the coupler to taper its output inside a minute. The medic or team lead owns the trigger. No debate on the floor."

"Three," he finished, "anchor protocol. People in a surge can still follow one trained cue. We use the same one Kaela used in recovery: two squeezes on the shoulder and a slow number count. It is not magic. It is a bridge while the spray and taper do their work. We tested it under controlled stress. It helps more often than it fails, and when it fails the spray still cuts the spike."

Liora crossed her arms. "List the abort thresholds."

"Any loss of recognition. Any strike at a teammate. Any tremor that does not settle in ten seconds. Any amber signal on the scope," Elias recited. "Those trigger the cooldown kit and a stop-work order. If the scene allows it, you remove the person from the task. If it does not, you taper them in place and pair them with a partner who finishes the count and the lift."

Kaela studied the board. "If the surge returns after the first minute."

"Then our usage limit was wrong," he answered. "That is on the system, not the person. We document and tighten the timing boundary before the next shift."

He turned one more card: House Rules, Not Heroics.

"We write this in plain terms and post it where anyone can point," he said. "Safety boundaries for timing. Usage limits on every device. Abort thresholds that do not bend. No speeches about will. No legends about strength. Keep people human while they help."

Kaela looked up. "Say it that way upstairs."

"I will," Elias replied.

He moved the models aside and brought up three short lists on a clean board.

"First," he told them, "Spiral Atrophy risks like Kaela benefit from short, honest windows on the base mesh. Less collapse of the ladder. No amber line if we keep the time tight."

"Second," he went on, "splice work lives on a timing boundary away from Sunfan. If they must share a clock, both drop to the floor of their ranges, and we keep a medic within arm's reach with the cooldown kit in hand."

"Third," he concluded, "for everyone else: we publish the safety boundaries. If anyone tries to push past a usage limit with a story about speed, the chart on the wall beats the story."

Kaela's shoulders came down a fraction. "Can we test the boundary without putting a person at risk."

"We can," Elias answered. "We run staged windows on cells and tissue. If those hold, we move to volunteers with clear consent and a stop on the first amber signal. We do not chase perfect. We make the fix safe enough for ordinary lives."

The senior tech lifted the tablet again. "Metrics are ready to log when you are."

Elias nodded once. He caught Liora's eye and held it. "I put the surge on the record," he told her. "I do not plan to buy clarity that way again."

Liora gave him one firm nod. "Good. Keep the work plain. Keep the boundaries hard."

The intercom light came on. Rane's voice carried clean into the room. "Two minutes, Doctor. Briefing room is set. They want the short version and the part they can carry."

Elias looked to Kaela. "Here first, then upstairs."

"Here first," she returned. She slid onto the stool beside him. "We show the ladder. We show the vine. We make the limits clear. We leave fear out of it."

Liora turned to the sink and washed her hands with steady strokes. "Keep your language clean," she advised. "No clever. No metaphor that feels like a trick. They are not here for a poem."

Elias set the amber filament back in its dish and left it coiled where it belonged. He picked up the green line and laid it through the rungs with care. "Plain, then," he concluded. "What holds, what harms, and where we cut it off."

They ran the sequence once more, not to rehearse words, but to walk the timing like a drill. When the chime sounded again, the room was ready, and so were the three of them. They stepped out together toward the briefing, a model, a board, and a plan that ordinary hands could pick up and use.

Kaela watched the green line lying neat across the rungs and felt her mouth go dry. She wanted to keep the talk on briefings and devices, not on her own hours that had started to slip again: the mornings with a small tremor that took too long to settle, the short climb of nausea that made food a task, the way lights felt sharp at the edge of her vision when she tried to read after dinner. She touched the bench with two fingers and kept her voice even.

"Speaking of boundaries," she began, then stopped to find the rest of it. "You know my symptoms are getting harder to control. When is it going to be safe for me."

The room did not answer. Elias looked at her and she felt the old pull to make it easier for him, to turn it into a joke about schedules or to say she could wait, but she was tired of giving ground she did not have. She thought about Joren learning to walk the corridor again without turning it into a story, and about Liora counting out pills with steady hands and never missing a line on a form, and she felt the mix of fear and impatience sit in her chest like a weight that would not move. She kept her eyes on the model so she would not try to fill the silence with promises neither of them could make. The question remained unanswered for now.
