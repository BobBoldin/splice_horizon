Chapter 15 - Pressure Rises

The dock antechamber was eerily quiet. Cold air slid through the thin gap at the hatch and pooled along the deck like water. Frost traced the edges of the viewport in fine threads. The walls carried old scuffs at knee height where crates once clipped the corners on bad days. Somewhere behind the panel, a motor ticked as it cooled.

Rook planted both hands on the lip and pulled. The hatch gave the length of a finger, then locked. Tamsin wedged the bent pry lower and leaned her weight. Lio pressed her shoulder to the steel. The gap opened just enough for a slim person to squeeze through sideways.

"Lio first," Rook told her. "Scout the dock, then hold from the far side."

She slipped through, ribs brushing metal, lamp held low and tight. A cold draft kissed her face and cleared the sweat from her jaw. She landed in a narrow dock tunnel with tape lines worn to ghost color. The air tasted like freezer burn. A derelict skiff sat nose-in at a crooked angle, its hoses limp, its hatch sealed with a hand twist of wire. Beyond that, the outer iris loomed shut, paint scored by tools that had failed to open it.

"Clear right," Lio called, voice a flat thread. "Two meters to cover."

Rook shifted the pry up. "Geir next. Turn sideways. Do not bump the ring."

Geir slid in with his eyes down. The lid light flared and he flinched, teeth bared for a moment he did not mean. He found the floor with care and kept one hand on the wall until his balance settled.

Tamsin went through and gave Rook her forearm. He took it, braced, and followed last with the tool bag dragging. The hatch clawed at his pack and then they were all through. The door relaxed back to its grudging gap and stopped.

They stood for a moment and listened. The rival crew had not pushed the antechamber yet. Maybe they were working the other door. Maybe they were counting.

"Status," Rook said.

Tamsin pulled a glove and checked Geir's side with clean fingers. The coupling pads felt warm and firm. The mix under the ring had thickened to a gel. Bleeding stayed down.

"Hold is good," she told him. "You have to keep your heart slow."

"It is slow," Geir answered. He kept his gaze on the floor tiles. "Keep the lamps off me."

"Noted," Rook said.

Lio moved to the skiff and worked the wire off the hatch with a twist. The cabin smelled like stale seals and old plastic. No power. The bench straps were brittle under her tug. She checked the cargo bay. Empty. No spare handle for the inner wheel. No patch kit on the wall.

"Nothing worth the time," she said. "I can use the hull for cover."

Rook gave the dock iris a long look. The manual wheel sat in place, but the panel next to it held three dead lights and a breaker with its handle snapped. He thumbed it anyway. It moved half a millimeter and stuck.

"We cannot open the iris from here without a handle or a patch," he told them. "So we finish this in the tunnel."

A faint scrape drifted from the antechamber. Not loud. Enough to say time was short.

Tamsin opened the slim black case again and checked the inventory. One ampoule left. Three pads unused. A coil of very fine mesh lay in the bottom, meant to shape around curved surfaces on a bench. She weighed it with her eye.

"Rook," she said, voice steady. "If the rival crew comes through and we have to sprint, Geir will tear the hold. The mix will peel. We need to reinforce it."

"Options," Rook answered.

"I can lace the edge with the fine mesh and tighten the ring. It will pull harder on the tissue. It buys more time."

"Cost."

\"Pain,\" Tamsin told him. \"And whatever template these kits carry. We do not know what it will push. There could be a cost we do not see yet.\"\
Geir shifted his weight. \"Do it,\" he said without looking up. \"I am not dying in a hallway.\"

Rook watched Tamsin's hands for a fraction of a second and then nodded once. "Fast."

She cut a narrow strip, fed it under the lip of the ring, and made small crosses with the mesh to bridge the edge. A quick press of pad to pad. The gel pulled in and tightened. Geir sucked in air through his teeth and forced it back out in a steady line.

"Hold here," Tamsin told Lio, placing two fingers. "Two minutes."

Footsteps thudded on the far side of the hatch. A soft tap-tap near the relay cover. Testing the seam. The rival crew had found the trail.

Rook raised his rifle and sighted along the skiff nose where the tunnel turned. He kept his breath even. Lio kept her shoulders loose and her lamp off. Tamsin counted under hers.

"One minute," she said.

The dock tunnel warmed by a notch. Heat leaked from a line that should have been cold. Frost receded in a small circle on the viewport, then returned. Something far inside the station clicked, failed to catch, and clicked again.

"Lio," Rook said, very quiet. "Walk me to the most breathable path to the inner hatch. We may have to run them around a corner or two."

Lio tilted her head and tasted the air. She pointed left, then down at the floor seam where a thin draft flowed. "Back toward the cold locker row, then a right cut into a maintenance loop. It stinks of coolant. They will hate it."

"Good," Rook said. "We do not have to love it."

"Time," Tamsin told them. She pressed the ring with two fingers. The gel held. The bleed stayed down. "He can move."

Geir pushed off the wall and found his feet. He kept his face turned away from the lamp and the skiff window. Hands shook, then steadied.

"Ready," Geir said. "Let us go."

Rook nodded. "Lio on point. Tamsin with Geir. I will take rear. If they show, two short shots to make space, then we turn the corner."

They moved. The dock tunnel funneled them into the square again. The hatch behind them remained at its thin gap. The rival crew reached the antechamber as they slipped around the first bend and threw a brick of light through the crack. Geir hissed and turned his head.

"Eyes down," Tamsin whispered.

They hit the fork and cut left. The air cooled as promised. The walls sweated. A thin film of frost cracked under their boots and turned wet at once. The smell of old coolant got into the mouth and sat there like a coin. Lio drove them into the maintenance loop and past a rack of ancient filters that shed gray powder when you brushed them.

"Right cut," Lio called. "Three doors. We want the middle."

They took it and found a narrow corridor with a line of shattered viewports. Patches had been laid over the breaks and the patches had failed years ago. The station skin held, but the panels bowed in like drum heads. Every step made a soft drum pulse you felt in the knees.

"Stop," Lio breathed. She held up a hand and crouched. "Listen."

They all listened. The rival crew had split. One pair took the path they had just left, boots ringing hollow on metal. Another moved along a parallel run that would meet them at the next junction.

"Shortcut?" Rook asked.

"Maybe," Lio answered. "There is a crawl under the junction. Tight."

Rook glanced at Geir. "Can you do a crawl."

Geir nodded once. "Do not shine a light."

They found the crawl two meters ahead where a grating had been kicked loose long ago. Lio dropped, twisted, and slid. The tunnel scraped her pack and took a line of dust off her sleeve like a dry brush. Tamsin pushed the case through, then Geir, then herself. Rook followed last and pulled the grating half back into place.

The crawl ran one body wide and stank of old air. Their elbows clicked on bolt heads. Twice the tunnel narrowed and they had to turn shoulders to pass. Lio paused at a junction where two dark pipes crossed and put her face to the draft.

"Left," she whispered. "The right goes to a dead valve."

They took the left and came up under a service hatch that opened into a small control room. The panels were dead. The chairs were gone. A red stencil on the far wall warned about pressure cycles nobody had run in years.

"Up," Rook said. He boosted Lio to the hatch and she worked the latch with her knife tip. The panel lifted with a soft groan. She slid through and pulled. Tamsin pushed Geir into the lightless room. Rook came last and lowered the hatch, leaving it loose enough to kick open again if they had to drop.

They were three rooms from the inner dock according to the map on the wall, but the map did not match the world. A corridor that should have gone straight now had a sag in the middle where a brace had failed. The floor pitched. A sign that should have pointed left had been ripped off and taped back upside down.

"Lio," Rook asked, quiet again.

She closed her eyes for a count and let the air tell her what the panel would not. "Left, then short right. We can get the dock from the side."

A footstep sounded two rooms back, muffled by the crawl they had used. The rival crew had found the grate.

Rook looked at Tamsin. She already had the case open on her knee, the last ampoule ready if they needed to push Geir one more time. Her mouth was set. No talk. Just work.

"Move," Rook said.

They slipped into the left corridor and felt heat rise again. This was not the soft bleed of a bad valve. This was a pocket, like a warm front trapped under metal. Paint bubbled under their palms if you rested too long. A length of loose conduit rattled in the wall and kept time with their steps.

Geir's breath shortened. Tamsin matched him and kept the pace steady. Lio's focus sharpened to a hard line and the rest of the world fell off her shoulders. She did not hear Rook when he asked for distance twice, and he let it go. They turned the short right and found the side door to the inner dock.

No power. Manual only. Wheel present, handle intact, light dead. The steel was cold to the touch here.

Rook set his hands to the wheel and leaned. It did not move. He set again and felt the first grudging turn.

Behind them, the rival crew's lamp found the corner and washed it for a moment white. It snapped off. Someone whispered. The voice came from closer than he liked.

"Two turns," Rook told them through his teeth. "Maybe three."

The wheel gave a half turn and stuck. Tamsin moved to help and the two of them pulled together. The lock bar inside the wall thumped and slid a little. Frost lifted off the seam like smoke.

Lio stood with rifle up and lamp off, sighted on a darker shadow in the dark. She did not blink.

The wheel hit the stop at one full turn. The bar moved another hand width and paused. Rook put his shoulder into it and felt a muscle in his neck go tight. He did not look away from the wheel.

"One more," he said, voice level.

A hand touched the crawl hatch behind them. The grate they had left loose clicked. A breath of warm air slid across the floor and raised the dust in a low wave.

Rook tightened his jaw and pulled.
