Chapter 23 - Ambush in the Galleries

"Flash on my call." Draeven's hand cut a short arc. "Close your eyes at the throw. Dark sensors on burst."

Hale reached into the door pouch and palmed an S-Pulse flash. Familiar weight. Thumb found the fuse and held it indexed. She counted two full breaths to keep rhythm. A scrape from the rear quarter. She tossed the cylinder low into the center lane. Lids down before it left her hand.

Light and pressure hit in a hard, short wash that stripped the room to pieces for a heartbeat. It ran along the floor and up the racks. The chest clap faded. Hale kept eyes shut through the trained count, then opened on one: the world returned as heat through the helmet's thermal. Racks: dim. Control panel: bright. Four bodies in white: two ahead and right, one high on a left rack, one behind the panel.

"Four. Right, right, left high, far."

"Far stays pinned." Draeven shifted to cover. "Front right first. Dax, net."

Dax already had the canister off the rig. One smooth draw. He tracked the nearest hot shape as it staggered, fired, and the net bloomed fast: a tight grid carrying its own current. It wrapped a thin body and dragged it to the deck with a light thud. A brief spasm as the current bit. Dax clipped the lead and set a boot to edge the roll. "One down. Net live."

The second hot shape on the right rushed low and quick, breaking line through the racks. Three heartbeats and it hit Joren's shoulder with enough drive to spin him. He slammed a rack, lost one hand on the carbine, knees going soft. He tried to set a stance and found nothing to set.

"I am hit. Right lane. Moving."

Hale broke left, then cut back on a diagonal to Joren that kept her clear of Dax's field. The attacker showed lean muscle and heat along the tendons, posture like a runner who knew how to change levels. A hand snapped for Joren's weapon wrist with practiced aim.

Hale did not reach. She slid through the knees from the side like a steal at second, taking his base. Shin across ankles. Hip through the line. He dropped clean: not a throw, just no legs left and gravity doing the rest. She pinned his arm at the elbow high so he could not post.

Joren planted a palm on her shoulder and surged to a crouch. "Up. Stable."

Rane's voice touched the net from the rear channel, calm and distant: "Status to board only."

"Two engaged, one netted, one down," Draeven replied. "Left high and far still live. Holding far."

Stun. Low."

Halden planted the S-Pulse on the attacker's shoulder and pressed a short burst. The flash did not travel far, but it stripped timing from a nervous system that wanted to surge. The man tried to roll. Hale rode the motion, let him carry her a quarter turn, then pinned him again: knee set in the pocket of his hip. Heat climbed along his neck on the helmet display. Below the airway. Not cooking. Just burning bright.

"Bind. Hands first." Draeven kept the lane covered.

Halden snapped a zip at the wrists while Hale kept weight where it counted. The man turned and showed his teeth, strength twitching without a plan. The zip bit and held. Hale rolled clear and let Halden finish: ankles to belt. A quick squeeze on fingers---capillary refill clean. "Circulation good."

"Left high. On the rack," Dax called.

The last shape had climbed while they worked the right lane. Two shelves up, held still like a hunter waiting a better angle. Long arms. Narrow chest. It watched without moving. Panel glow behind it threw a hard line along the wall.

"Do not hit the panel. We want the power," Draeven warned.

Hale ran a parallel lane to gain angle without crossing Dax. The climber read the shift and dropped: knees bent, hands out, clean landing that kept options open. No sprint. A slide to the ladder ring Joren had marked, hand reaching for the first rung.

"Joren, block."

He moved this time without the hitch from a moment ago. Stepped into the ladder circle and set his carbine cross-body to fill space, not strike. The hand hit the barrel and skidded. A drop low: he fed a knee into the gap and closed it. An elbow came high toward his face. Chin tucked. The shot rang his ears off the helmet shell. Feet stayed under him. He let the elbow pass, clamped the forearm with both hands, turned his hips for weight. Ugly, but it worked. The body in front of him lost speed.

Dax closed, net canister still clipped at his belt. A fresh launch would foul on the rack. He holstered the canister, drew the sidearm with shatter-frangible, and placed one round at the deck in front of the lead foot. The slug broke as designed, energy and dust without metal coming back. The shock checked the forward drive and bought a second.

"Take him."

Hale went low at the shins, shoulder square. The body folded like a ragdoll. Halden stepped through and took the wrist; the zip bit fast. Dax pressed behind the knees until ankles met deck. Joren held the forearm until the pull shifted from fight to strain, then eased off and slid back half a pace to clear the lane.

"Three secure. Net, cuffs, cuffs."

"Far target?"

They all looked to the panel. The fourth heat signature was gone. The panel still burned bright. The ladder ring stood open. A thin smear of warm handprint marked the edge of the far rack and broke off at the door.

"Runner broke contact. Far door."

"Do not chase blind. Check oxygen. Reset formation." Draeven's voice stayed close and steady.

Joren felt his breath stack in his throat and spread it out the way Hale had taught him. He met her eyes through the visor. A small nod: enough for now. He returned it once and felt the shake in his hands settle to something he could carry.

"Dark sensors stay on. Move to the door in two lines. Dax, recover the net. Hale, check the plates before we pass."

Dax killed the current and reeled the grid in slow so the coils would not tangle. Hale inspected the weight plate under the crate and left it as set. A sweep of the thermal cone over the next two meters showed no heat that did not belong. Halden watched the ceiling for any partner to the climber. Nothing moved.

They reached the frame and stacked. Beyond: no light, and thermal bled to a wash at this range. The runner had left a choice: push into a black hall or hold and risk a flank through an unmapped side cut.

"On my call. We go through."

A relay clicked at the panel behind them. Small sound, sharp in the quiet. Hale tightened her grip and set her stance. Joren tapped two fingers on the back of her rig to mark that he was on her line. Dax clipped the canister and put a hand on the latch.

"Go."

The door opened two inches and caught. A brace on the far side. Dax set his shoulder and drove. Wood or metal scraped, then gave. The door swung. The gallery beyond held no light. Thermals showed a long, narrow corridor with a few warm smears along the wall where hands had passed. Halfway down, a pale shape flickered once and disappeared, like someone waving a heat source for a second.

"Trap. Short lane."

"Enter. Two and two."

They stepped through into complete darkness.
