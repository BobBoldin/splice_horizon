Chapter 23 - Ambush in the Galleries

"Flash on my call," Rane said. "Close your eyes at the throw. Dark sensors up on burst."

Hale reached into the door pouch and palmed an S-Pulse flash. The size and shape were familiar. She let her thumb find the fuse switch and held it indexed. She counted two full breaths to keep her rhythm steady. When the scrape came again from the rear quarter she tossed the cylinder low into the center lane. Her lids were down before it left her hand.

Light and pressure hit in a hard, short wash that stole shape from the room. It rolled along the floor and up the racks. The clap of it hit the chest and faded. Hale's eyes stayed closed through the count they trained for. She opened on one, and the world came back in a wash of heat signatures through the helmet's thermal mode. The racks glowed dim. The control panel burned bright. Four bodies showed as white shapes at different heights, two ahead and right, one high on a rack near their left, one behind the panel.

"Four," Hale said. "Right, right, left high, far."

"Far stays pinned," Rane said. "Front right first. Dax, net."

Dax was already up. The net canister came off the rig in one clean draw. He tracked the nearest hot shape as it staggered from the flash and fired. The net bloomed fast, a sudden grid that carried its own current. It wrapped a thin body and pulled it down to the deck with a thud that did not sound heavy. The figure spasmed once as the net bit. Dax kept the lead clipped and set his boot at the edge to stop a roll. "One down. Net live."

The second hot shape on the right moved in a rush, low and quick, making a broken line through the racks. It cleared a lane in three heartbeats and hit Joren at the shoulder with enough drive to knock him sideways. He hit the rack hard, lost one hand on his carbine, and felt his knees go soft. He tried to set a stance and found he did not have one.

"I am hit," Joren said. His voice sounded too loud in his own ears. "Right lane. Moving."

Hale broke left, then cut back to Joren's side at a diagonal that kept her out of Dax's field. The attacker carried lean muscle and heat along the tendons. He had the posture of a runner who knew how to change levels. He reached for Joren's weapon wrist as if he had practiced it. Hale did not try to out-reach him. She slid into his knees from the side like a player stealing second in a tight game and took his base away. Her shin cut his ankles. Her hip drove through his line. He fell clean, not because she threw him but because his legs were gone and gravity had the rest. She took his arm at the elbow and held it high so he could not post. Joren found his feet again by planting against her shoulder and pushing to a crouch.

"Stun," Hale said. "Low."

Halden placed the S-Pulse at the attacker's shoulder and fired a short press. The flash did not travel far, but it was enough to strip timing from a nervous system that wanted to surge. The man tried to roll. Hale rode the motion and let him carry her a quarter turn before she pinned him again with her knee in the pocket of his hip. The helmet showed heat climbing along his neck. It stayed below the airway. He was not cooking himself. He was just burning bright.

"Bind," Rane said. "Hands first."

Halden snapped a zip at the wrists while Hale kept weight where it mattered. The man turned his head and bared his teeth, but his strength did not organize into a plan. The zip bit and held. Hale rolled clear and let Halden finish ankles to belt. She checked finger color with a quick squeeze and saw capillary refill in a clean time. "Circulation good."

"Left high," Dax said. "On the rack."

The last shape had climbed while they worked the right lane. It clung to a shelf two levels up and held still like a cat that wants a better angle. The heat pattern showed long arms and a narrow chest. It watched them without moving. The panel glow behind it threw a hard line on the wall.

"Do not shoot the panel," Rane said. "We still want the power."

Hale ran a lane to get a better angle without crossing into Dax. The climber read the shift and dropped. It came down with knees bent and hands out, a good landing that gave it a chance to move again. It did not sprint. It slid sideways to the ladder ring Joren had marked and reached for the first rung.

"Joren, block," Hale said.

He moved without the hitch that had made him slow a moment ago. He stepped into the ladder circle and set his carbine cross-body, not to strike, but to fill space. The climber's hand hit the barrel and skidded. It tried to go low. He put his knee into the line and took that lane away. It turned and brought an elbow high toward his face. He kept his chin tucked. The elbow glanced off the helmet and rang his ears. He kept his feet. He let the elbow pass and grabbed the forearm with both hands while turning his hips to add weight. It was ugly but it worked. The body in front of him lost speed.

Dax closed the distance with the net still clamped to his belt. He could have opened a new canister and fired again, but the angle was tight and the rack behind the target would make the spread foul. He holstered the canister and drew his sidearm loaded with shatter-frangible. He placed one round at the floor in front of the attacker's lead foot. The slug disintegrated as designed and sprayed energy without throwing metal back at them. The shock and dust stopped the forward drive. It bought them a second.

"Take him," Rane said.

Hale went in low again, this time at the shins, and set her shoulder square. The body folded. Halden stepped through and took the wrist. The zip bit fast. Dax moved behind the knees and pressed down until the ankles met the deck. Joren held the forearm until he felt the pull change from fight to strain, then let go and stepped back a half pace to stay out of the way.

"Three secure," Halden said. "Net, cuffs, cuffs."

"Far target?" Rane asked.

They all looked to the panel. The fourth heat signature was gone. The panel still burned bright. The ladder ring stood open. A thin smear of warm handprint showed on the edge of the far rack and broke off at the door.

"Runner broke contact," Hale said. "Far door."

"Do not chase blind," Rane said. "Check your oxygen. Reset formation."

Joren felt his breath in his throat and spread it out the way Hale had taught him. He looked at her and found her eyes through the visor. She gave a small nod that said he had done enough for now. He nodded back once and felt the shake in his hands settle to something he could carry.

"Dark sensors stay on," Rane said. "We move to the door in two lines. Dax, recover the net. Hale, check the plates on the floor before we pass."

Dax killed the current and reeled the grid in slow to keep the coils from tangling. Hale inspected the weight plate under the crate and left it as it was. She ran the thermal cone over the next two meters and saw no new heat that did not belong. Halden watched the ceiling for the climber's friend who had not shown. Nothing moved.

They reached the door frame and stacked. The space beyond held no light at all, and the thermal read bled into a wash at the range they had. The runner had left them a choice: follow into a black hall or hold ground and risk a flanking move through a side cut they had not mapped.

"On my call," Rane said. "We go through."

The panel behind them clicked once as a relay shifted. The tiny noise felt large in the quiet. Hale tightened her grip and set her stance. Joren tapped the back of her rig with two fingers to say he was on her line. Dax set the canister back on the clip and put his hand on the latch.

"Go," Rane said.

The door moved two inches and stopped. Something on the far side had been braced against it. Dax set his shoulder and shoved. The brace scraped and gave. The door swung. The gallery beyond breathed no light at all. Their thermals showed a corridor that ran long and narrow with a handful of warm smears along the wall where hands had passed. Halfway down the lane a pale shape flickered and vanished like a hand waving a heat source for a second.

"Trap," Hale said. "Short lane."

"Enter," Rane said. "Two and two."

They stepped through, and the dark took them.
